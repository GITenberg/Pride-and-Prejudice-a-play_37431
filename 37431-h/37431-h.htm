<div class="blockquot3"><p class="hang">MR. DARCY&mdash;(<span class="smcap">of Pemberley, Derbyshire</span>). "<i>Possessed of a fine tall
person, handsome features, noble mien, and ... ten thousand a year
... clever ... haughty, reserved and fastidious; his manners,
though well-bred, were not inviting. 'Some people call him proud,'
said Mrs. Reynolds, the housekeeper at Pemberley, 'but I am sure I
never saw anything of it.... He is the best landlord and the best
master that ever lived.'</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">MR. BINGLEY&mdash;(<span class="smcap">of Netherfield, Hertfordshire, Darcy's Friend</span>).
"<i>Just what a young man ought to be; sensible and good-humoured,
lively ... such happy manners! So much ease, with such perfect good
breeding.... Also handsome, which a young man ought likewise to be
if he possibly can.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">COLONEL FITZWILLIAM&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Cousin to Darcy</span>). "<i>About thirty, not
handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">MR. BENNET&mdash;(<span class="smcap">of Longbourn</span>). "<i>An odd mixture of quick parts,
sarcastic humour, reserve and caprice. He was fond of the country
and of books, and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">MR. COLLINS&mdash;(<span class="smcap">a Cousin of Mr. Bennet, and Next in the Entail of
Longbourn Estate.</span>) "<i>A tall, heavy-looking young man of
five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners
very formal. His veneration for his patroness, Lady Catherine de
Bourg, mingling with a very good opinion of himself and of his
authority as a clergyman ... made him altogether a mixture of pride
and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">SIR WILLIAM LUCAS&mdash;(<span class="smcap">an Intimate Friend and Neighbour of the
Bennets</span>). "<i>Formerly in trade in Meryton ... he had risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the King during his
mayoralty. The distinction had ... given him a disgust to his
business, and, ... quitting it, he had removed ... to Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and ...
occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">COLONEL FORSTER&mdash;(<span class="smcap">the Colonel of the Regiment Stationed at
Meryton</span>).</p>

<p class="hang">MR. WICKHAM&mdash;(<span class="smcap">an Officer in the Regiment</span>). "<i>Endowed with all the
best parts of beauty&mdash;a fine countenance, a good figure, and a very
pleasing address. As false and deceitful as he is insinuating.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">MR. DENNY&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Another Officer in the Regiment</span>).</p>

<p class="hang">HARRIS&mdash;(<span class="smcap">the Butler at Longbourn</span>).</p>

<p class="hang">MRS. BENNET&mdash;(<span class="smcap">the Wife of Mr. Bennet</span>). "<i>A woman of mean
understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she
was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her
life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and
news.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">JANE&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Eldest Daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet</span>). "<i>She united with
great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform
cheerfulness of manner. Her mild and steady candour always pleaded
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">ELIZABETH&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Their Second Daughter</span>). "<i>Although not so handsome as
Jane, her face was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful
expression of her dark eyes. She had a lively, playful disposition,
which delighted in anything ridiculous, with more quickness of
observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister. There was a
mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it
difficult for her to affront anybody.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">LYDIA&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Their Youngest Daughter</span>). "<i>A stout, well-grown girl of
fifteen, with a fine complexion and a good-humoured countenance&mdash;a
favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into
public at an early age.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">LADY LUCAS&mdash;(<span class="smcap">the Wife of Sir William</span>). "<i>Not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">CHARLOTTE LUCAS&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Daughter of Sir William and Lady Lucas</span>). "<i>A
sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, ...
Elizabeth's intimate friend.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">MISS BINGLEY&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Sister of Mr. Bingley</span>). "<i>A very fine lady ... but
proud and conceited.</i>"</p>

<p>LADY CATHERINE DE BOURG&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Aunt of Darcy and Patroness of Mr.
Collins</span>). "<i>A tall, large woman, with strongly marked features,
which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating.... Whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative
a tone as marked her self-importance.</i>"</p>

<p class="hang">HILL&mdash;(<span class="smcap">the Housekeeper at Longbourn</span>).</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The drawing-room at Longbourn. At the back, wide glass doors open upon
a terrace which overlooks an English landscape. It is winter, and coals
are burning in the fireplace. On each side of the glass doors are
rounded recesses with windows. On one side of the room a door opens into
the library. On the other side is a door to the hall&mdash;the chief entrance
of the house. The room is handsomely furnished in eighteenth century
style.</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>are discovered sitting on either side of
the table.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>is knitting&mdash;</i><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet</span> <i>reading.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a slight pause and laying down her knitting.</i>]</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Bennet, did not you hear me? Did you know that Netherfield
Park is let at last?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Continues reading and does not answer.</i>]<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Do not you want to know who has taken it?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ceases reading and looks up at her with an amused smile.</i>] You want to
tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With animation.</i>] Why, my dear, you must know Lady Lucas says that
Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the North of
England. His name is Bingley, and he is <i>single</i>, my dear. Think of
that, Mr. Bennet! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand
pounds a year. What a fine thing for our girls!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>How so? How can it affect them?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>My dear Mr. Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am
thinking of his marrying one of them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Is that his design in settling here?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Design!&mdash;Nonsense! How can you talk so? But it is very likely that he
will fall in love with one of them, and<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a> therefore you must visit him as
soon as you can. Consider your daughters, Mr. Bennet! Only think what an
establishment it would be for one of them! Sir William and Lady Lucas
are determined to go merely on that account. Indeed you must go, for it
will be impossible for us to visit him if <i>you</i> do not.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has risen during this last speech and now stands with his back to
the fire, facing</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span>] You are overscrupulous, surely. I dare
say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you, and I will send a few
lines to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he
chooses of the girls&mdash;though I must throw in a good word for my little
Lizzy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sharply.</i>] I desire you will do no such thing! Lizzy is not a bit
better than the others. She is not half as handsome as Jane, nor as
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Not unless she deserves it, my dear. But in this particular instance my
poor little Lizzy is the only one who is unprovided for. Lydia and the
others belong in the schoolroom, and you tell me that Mr. Collins has
already spoken for Jane.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that odious Mr. Collins! I wish he had never come here. I wish I
might never hear his name again!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Collins odious! You surprise me! I thought that he had won your full
approval.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Fretfully.</i>] Oh, well, since he had to be your cousin, and since you
<i>will</i> not do anything about the entail, I suppose it will be a mercy if
he does marry Jane. [<i>Half crying.</i>] But I do think, Mr. Bennet, it is
the hardest thing in the world that we have no son of our own, so that
your property has to be entailed away from your own wife and children,
so if you should die, we may all be turned out of the house whenever
this Mr. Collins pleases. [<i>In bewailing tone.</i>] He certainly does seem
to have all the luck in the world. Here he has just got this good living
from that grand Lady Catherine de Bourg.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear, that will soon be <i>your</i> luck, as well. You forget that
your daughter is to profit by it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, perhaps. I don't know about <i>that</i>, but, [<i>With renewed
excitement.</i>] I <i>do</i> know that it is too monstrous<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a> that after you are
gone I shall be forced to make way for this man and live to see him
master in this house!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better
things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>This is not very consoling to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>; <i>and therefore, instead of
making answer, she goes on as before.</i>] If it was not for the entail I
should not mind it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>What should not you mind?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I should not mind anything at all.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility. But it certainly is a most iniquitous affair, and nothing
can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. However,
you know he is doing his best to mend matters. He has not only
handsomely apologised for his fault, but he has now assured us of his
readiness to make every possible amends by marrying one of the girls.
Surely, my dear, you must acknowledge that this plan is excessively
generous on his part.<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dolefully.</i>] Well, I suppose it might be worse.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Cheerfully.</i>] Decidedly worse. With Jane so well settled, and a single
man like Mr. Bingley in prospect, I think you should be quite cheerful.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Excited once more.</i>] Mr. Bingley! We shall never know Mr. Bingley. Oh,
Mr. Bennet, you take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my
poor nerves.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>You mistake, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my
old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
twenty years at least.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Ah! You do not know what I suffer.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bursting into the room, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Jane.</span>] Oh, that horrid practice!
[<i>Looking back at</i> <span class="smcap">Jane.</span>] Jane does so keep me at it. [<i>Throwing herself
into a chair.</i>] La, I'm tired to death.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who sees that her mother is half crying, goes and<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a> stands behind her
chair, puts her hand affectionately on her shoulder, and bends over
her.</i>] Does your head ache, mamma?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Of course my head aches. Your father is so teasing. I cannot persuade
him to call on Mr. Bingley at Netherfield, so I suppose we shall never
know him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] But you forget, mamma, that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and Lady Lucas has promised to introduce him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I do not believe Lady Lucas will do any such thing. She has daughters of
her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
her.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>No more have I, and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her
serving you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I may have to depend on her after all, Mr. Bennet, since you will do
nothing to help me. [<i>Fretfully to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>, <i>who has been yawning and
coughing.</i>] Don't keep coughing, Lydia, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>pouts and looks unutterable things.</i>]<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Lydia has no discretion in her coughs. She times them ill.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I do not cough for my own amusement, papa. Jane, when is your next ball?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>To-morrow fortnight.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting excitedly.</i>] Ay, so it is&mdash;and Lady Lucas does not come back
till the day before. So you see it will be impossible for her to
introduce Mr. Bingley, for she will not know him herself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and <i>you</i> can
introduce Mr. Bingley to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Impossible, Mr. Bennet, when I am not acquainted with him myself. How
can you be so teasing?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little. But if <i>we</i> do not venture, somebody else will, and if
<i>you</i> decline the office <i>I</i> will take it upon myself.<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As the two girls stare at their father.</i>] Oh, nonsense&mdash;nonsense! I am
sick of Mr. Bingley!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had
known as much a week ago, I certainly should not have called upon him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Springing from her chair and throwing her arms about</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet's</span>
<i>neck.</i>] What! You have really called upon him? Oh, how good in you, my
dear Mr. Bennet!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit&mdash;and as he
will very likely return it at any time, and bring his friend, Mr. Darcy,
with him&mdash;we cannot now avoid the acquaintance of Mr. Bingley and his
party.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet, I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. [<span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet</span> <i>deftly takes her hands from
his shoulders. She stands looking fondly at him.</i>] Well, how pleased I
am! And it was such a good joke that you should have already paid Mr.
Bingley a visit and never said a word about it.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes. Yes. Well, I must go to the library. [<i>He goes to the door, but
stops for a moment.</i>] Now, Lydia, you can cough as much as you choose.
[<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking after</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span>] What an excellent father you have, girls!
[<i>Turns to the girls.</i>] I do not know how you will ever make him amends
for his kindness, or me either, for that matter. At our time of life it
is not so pleasant to be making new acquaintances every day. But for
your sakes we would do anything. [<i>Looking about her.</i>] Where is Lizzy?
Lydia, my love, where is your sister?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, she is out walking with Charlotte Lucas and that dismal Mr. Collins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Lizzy&mdash;out walking with Mr. Collins? Why didn't <i>you</i> go, Jane?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>I had to practise with Lydia.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I'm sure I would have excused you. But what is Mr. Collins here for,
mamma? I am sure I caught Mr. Wickham and Colonel Forster laughing at
him the day we went to Meryton. Why does papa have a cousin like that?<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>He really cannot help it. It is the entail, my love&mdash;[<i>Mysteriously.</i>]
But I hope that all you girls will be very civil to him, Jane
especially.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>I&mdash;mamma?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Embarrassed.</i>] Yes&mdash;my love.&mdash;You see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>She is interrupted by the sound of laughter outside, and</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth's</span>
<i>voice.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Very well, Mr. Collins.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>makes a sudden awed gesture of silence to the girls, who
fail to understand.</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>enters by the glass doors. She is
dressed in winter walking costume: a large hat,&mdash;fur-trimmed pelerine,
and a large muff. She stops in the doorway and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>,
<i>half puzzled and smiling.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Well, what is it, mamma? What is the matter?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Nothing. Hush! What have you done with Mr. Collins?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] Oh, Mr. Collins is safe! He has gone round to the
library.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>] How providential!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking back.</i>] But I have brought someone else with me.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Wickham</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte Lucas</span> <i>come in gaily.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Exclaiming.</i>] Oh, Mr. Wickham!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span>] How do you do, Mrs. Bennet? This is indeed a
pleasure. [<i>Going over to</i> <span class="smcap">Jane.</span>] Miss Bennet, I am <i>so</i> glad to see
you. [<i>Reproachfully.</i>] You were not with our party! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] Why
do you never come to Meryton, Miss Lydia? Mr. Denny is quite downcast.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pouting.</i>] La, Mr. Denny!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>And many others beside him, Miss Lydia.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>giggles.</i> <span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>returns to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, 'tis an age since we saw you, Mr. Wickham. What <i>have</i> you been
doing?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Colonel Forster keeps me so busy that I have no time for enjoyment.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Wickham bears all the marks of an harassed and overworked man.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bowing to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Thank you, Miss Elizabeth. You have given me
the very terms I needed. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>.] You see before you, Mrs.
Bennet, an harassed and overworked man. Miss Elizabeth will bear witness
that I was on my way to a business appointment when I yielded to
temptation and went off for a walk with her and Miss Lucas and their
irreproachable escort.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>And Miss Elizabeth will also testify that you yielded with the celerity
and ease of long practice.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing; to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] But in this case who was the tempter?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I will admit that Mr. Collins was partially responsible.</p>

<p>[<i>All laugh.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Come, Lizzy, you have been talking to Mr. Wickham all the morning. Now,
let some of the rest of us have a chance. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Wickham</span>.] You
must stay to dinner, Mr. Wickham.<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I wish I might. That is indeed a temptation. But you know Miss Elizabeth
has just reminded me of my duty.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nobody ever minds Lizzy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Truly, I cannot to-day, Mrs. Bennet. It is too bad, but I am to meet
Colonel Forster [<i>Smiling at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>] on important <i>business</i> at the
Drake Farm.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, I am very sorry.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] I might perhaps bring Colonel Forster in for a few
moments on the way back&mdash;that is, if we return this way.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">All.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, do.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, indeed. Tell Colonel Forster we should be delighted to see him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Thank you, I will. But now I really must be gone. [<i>Bowing brightly to</i>
<span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] Good morning.<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte Lucas.</span>] Good morning, Miss Lucas. You must let me hear
more about those clever plans of yours. I am vastly interested in them.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Good morning, Miss Elizabeth. [<i>Laughing.</i>] You must
try to temper your justice with mercy the next time I join you in a
walk. [<i>Pausing, he looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>, <i>who is standing between her
daughters.</i>] Do you know, Mrs. Bennet, that you always remind me of one
of my old schoolboy phrases. <i>Filiæ pulchræ!&mdash;Mater pulchrior!</i>
Good-bye.</p>

<p>[<i>He runs off laughing. He has only gone a few steps when</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia,</span> <i>who
has been standing close to the door, runs out and calls to him.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Wickham!</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>turns and</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>runs up to him and whispers something in his
ear.</i> <span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>laughs, then shakes his finger at her, still laughing,
and goes off.</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>stops outside and watches him.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Really, mamma, I think you should speak to Lydia. She is too forward.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! You are jealous.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Jealous! Of Lydia<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, she is no more forward than any of you. All you girls are crazy
about Mr. Wickham. [<i>Indulgently.</i>] But I can't wonder at it. He
certainly is a most engaging young man. What were those French words he
said to me as he went out, Lizzy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>They were Latin, dear. He paid a very charming compliment to our pretty
mamma. He said&mdash;The daughters are lovely, but the mother is lovelier.
You know papa always says that you are handsomer than any of us.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>My dear Lizzy, I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I don't
pretend to be anything extraordinary now. [<span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>enters.</i>] Oh,
Mr. Collins, there you are.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bowing profoundly.</i>] I do not find Mr. Bennet in the library, Madam.
Do you know where he is?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Why, really, Mr. Collins, I can't imagine. Did you enjoy your walk?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Most assuredly, Madam. The beauties of nature, not only in the
landscape, but also [<i>Bowing to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>and</i><a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a> <span class="smcap">Charlotte Lucas</span>.] in
the blooming countenances of my fair companions, made our expedition a
peculiarly enjoyable one.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, I am very glad of it, I am sure. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.] Girls,
we haven't told Lizzy and Charlotte the news.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>What news, mamma?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>with an ill-concealed triumph</i>.] Oh, nothing of
consequence, Lizzy, only your father has just told us that we may expect
a visit at any time from our new neighbour, Mr. Bingley, and that friend
of his who is stopping with him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Bingley! That will be entertaining. [<i>Suddenly with mischief she
turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span>, <i>who all through this latter conversation has
been staring at</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>with solemn persistence</i>.] Do not you think so,
Mr. Collins?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting from his absorption.</i>] Eh? What? [<i>Pompously again.</i>] Excuse
me, Miss Elizabeth, on what subject did you ask my opinion<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I asked you if you didn't think it was a very pleasant thing to meet new
neighbours.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Most assuredly, Miss Elizabeth, if those neighbours are possessed of
those qualifications which redound to their own credit, and to the
edification of their friends. Otherwise, as a clergyman, I must hesitate
in my approval. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>.] You realise, I am sure, Madam, the
caution which should ever be exercised where my amiable young cousins
are concerned.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, mamma, you really should be cautious.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! Why, my dear Mr. Collins, we have found out all about them.
Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy are connected with some of the most
respectable families in England.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In amazement.</i>] Mr. Darcy? Mr. Fitzgerald Darcy! My dear Madam, can it
be possible that you are to be honoured by a visit from him? Respectable
indeed! Why, he is the nephew of my noble patroness, Lady Catherine de
Bourg. It is true that I have never yet had the honour of meeting
him&mdash;but he frequently visits his aunt, and she has promised to bring
him on some occasion to inspect<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a> my humble abode. I am surprised,
indeed, by this civility on his part. [<i>Anxiously.</i>] I only fear there
may be some mistake, for Mr. Darcy has the reputation of possessing a
very natural pride of birth; but if your information is indeed to be
relied upon, I think Lady Catherine would consent to my approval of this
visit, provided my fair cousins will keep in mind the proper attitude of
respectful humility which should be assumed toward a person of his
superior station.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>We will promise you, Mr. Collins, never for one instant to forget either
Mr. Darcy's exalted position or our own insignificance.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at her with admiration.</i>] With that assurance, Miss Elizabeth,
I think even Lady Catherine would be satisfied. So I need no longer
withhold my sanction.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Curtsying.</i>] We thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>This is the very attitude of mind I could desire. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>.] I
think, with your permission, I will now retire again to the library.
[<i>Going over smilingly to</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] There was a volume of Fordyce's
sermons that you may remember I was reading to you in this room
yesterday. I<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a> do not find it in the library. Do you know where it is?
[<i>Looking about him.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>I haven't seen it, Mr. Collins. I will try to find it for you. [<i>She
starts as if to go out of the room.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wishing to leave them together.</i>] No&mdash;no, Lydia will find it. Lydia,
my love, go see if you can find the sermons for Mr. Collins.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Lydia</span>, <i>with a grimace, rises slowly from her chair</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte Lucas.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Bennet, I am quite sure that I saw the book in the hall. I will
go fetch it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sharply.</i>] On no account, Charlotte. Lydia will find the book. Lizzy,
go and get the mud off your shoes.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I will not trouble any of you ladies.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>It is no trouble, Mr. Collins. Charlotte, if you will come with me, I
have a parcel I should like to send your mother<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>But I assure you, Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As they go out</i>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>&mdash;<i>looking daggers at</i>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Lydia will find your book, Mr. Collins.</p>

<p>On no account, Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>With awkward gallantry</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>ushers out the

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an amused smile, having watched the party vanish, turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>
<i>and speaks to her in mock-heroic fashion</i>.] Miss Bennet! Do you realise
the honour which is so soon to fall upon our humble home, and our
gratefully humble selves?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Oh, Lizzy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Do you really grasp in its full significance the fact that we may soon
be honoured by a visit from Mr. Bingley of<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a> Netherfield and Mr.
Fitzgerald Darcy, nephew of the Lady Catherine de Bourg?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Lizzy, Mr. Collins is a little pompous, but he seems a very
well-meaning young man&mdash;indeed, sometimes quite agreeable.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking quizzically, but affectionately, at her sister.</i>] No one can
be anything but agreeable in the mind of our dear Jane. This time,
however, I quite agree with you, I am as delighted as papa with Mr.
Collins. I can see that his mixture of servility and importance promises
well.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>And I think Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy promise well. If the half of what
our neighbours say is true, Mr. Bingley will give us all sorts of
gaieties. [<i>Slyly.</i>] Who knows? We may find him as entertaining as Mr.
Wickham.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>As Mr. Wickham? Then, dear Jane, we shall be rich indeed. [<i>Counting on
her fingers.</i>] For hospitality&mdash;Mr. Bingley; for conversation&mdash;Mr.
Wickham; for grandeur&mdash;Mr. Darcy, and the agreeable Mr. Collins!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Lizzy! Can not you let the poor man alone<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>With all my heart. I will gladly let him alone. You shall have him all
to yourself. [<i>Mischievously.</i>] If only Mr. Collins knew your good
opinion of him! But he is too modest to find it out for himself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Playfully pulling</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth's</span> <i>ear</i>.] You are a tease!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Harris.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering.</i>] The two gentlemen from Netherfield have just brought their
horses into the paddock, Madam.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Show them in, Harris, and speak to Mrs. Bennet at once.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Harris</span> <i>bows and goes out</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>They have come soon, Lizzy. Really this is very civil in them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Uncommonly civil. Come with me, Jane. I must make myself tidy. Mud and
dirty petticoats for Mr. Darcy!&mdash;Oh, that would never do.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They run off, laughing. There is a short pause. Then</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bingley</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Darcy</span> <i>enter. The latter is very quiet, with an air of
scornful<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a> hauteur</i>. <span class="smcap">Bingley</span>, <i>on the contrary, has a gracious and
animated manner</i>. <span class="smcap">Harris</span> <i>ushers them in, much impressed</i>.]</p></div>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Harris</span>.] You will announce us to Mr. Bennet and the ladies.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Harris</span> <i>goes out</i>.]</p>

<p>Do you know, Darcy, I believe that was George Wickham we saw just now,
going toward the Drake Farm.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quietly.</i>] I think there is no doubt of it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>But what is he doing here?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With assumed indifference.</i>] Probably it is his regiment which is
stationed at Meryton.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Excitedly.</i>] No, Darcy! You don't mean it! Why, confound it, if I had
had any notion of that&mdash;I ... I....</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Contemptuously.</i>] I don't think we need mind Wickham<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>But I do mind! To think that I should bring you into the neighbourhood
of that rascal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>He must live somewhere, I suppose.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Yes, unfortunately. But, Darcy, you are a puzzle to me.&mdash;You are,
indeed! How can you speak with any charity of a man who for years abused
the patience and generous kindness of your father, and who so lately has
attempted against your family the most dastardly action that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting him with hauteur.</i>] We have already said too much of
George Wickham. I prefer not to discuss him further.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>turns away hurt and embarrassed</i>. <span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>seeing the
effect of his words and manner, goes to him kindly, and speaks to
him in a changed voice</i>.]</p></div>

<p>Bingley, I entirely understand your indignation. Indeed, I share it so
fully that I dare not trust myself to think of the man's villainy. It is
better that I say nothing of him, even to you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">BINGLEY.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Moved.</i>] I am sure, I beg your pardon, Darcy<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>It is rather for me to ask yours.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>There follows an awkward pause, which <span class="smcap">Bingley</span> at length breaks by
speaking in a tone of forced gaiety</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Pretty place, this.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a shrug.</i>] Very small.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>What has the size to do with it? I think we are in luck to have such
charming neighbours. You know we saw two of the young ladies going
through the lane the other day. Why, Darcy, one of them is the most
beautiful creature I ever beheld&mdash;and the other&mdash;the one with the dark
eyes&mdash;she is uncommonly pretty. Don't you think so?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>She is tolerable, but fine eyes cannot change family connections.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shortly.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>And that they have another in London who lives somewhere near Cheapside.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With irritation.</i>] If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside, it
wouldn't make them one jot less handsome.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>But it must materially lessen their chances of marrying men of any
consideration in the world.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Of marrying? You go fast, Darcy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps. But I am in no humour to give consequence to young ladies. I am
here to please you, Bingley&mdash;and&mdash;[<i>He smiles meaningly.</i>] knowing your
disposition, I think it is just as well that I came.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>is about to reply when the door opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Good morning, gentlemen. I am so sorry that Mr. Bennet has gone for his
walk.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As she looks a little puzzled from one to the other</i>, <span class="smcap">Bingley</span>
<i>advances</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Good morning, Mrs. Bennet. I am Mr. Bingley, your new neighbour at
Netherfield. This is my friend, Mr. Darcy, of Pendleton, Derbyshire.
[<i>All bow and curtsy.</i>] Mr. Bennet has been so kind as to call upon us,
and we are most happy to have the honour of waiting upon the ladies of
his family.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>We are delighted to see you, I am sure! Mr. Bingley&mdash;Mr.
Darcy&mdash;[<i>Indicating</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>]&mdash;my eldest daughter, Miss Bennet.
[<i>Indicating</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>]&mdash;Miss Elizabeth Bennet.</p>

<p>[<i>The girls make low curtsies&mdash;the gentlemen bow.</i>]</p>

<p>Will not you be seated, gentlemen? [<i>The guests and ladies seat
themselves.</i>] I am sure you must like Netherfield, Mr. Bingley. I do not
know a place in the country<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a> that is equal to Netherfield. You will not
think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short
lease.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Whatever I do is done in a hurry, Mrs. Bennet, and therefore if I should
resolve to quit Netherfield I should probably be off in five minutes. At
present, however, [<i>looking intently at</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>] I consider myself as
quite fixed here.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>It is very pleasant to have Netherfield open once more, although you
must both miss London. There is so much gaiety in London.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Yes, in a country neighbourhood you move in a confined and unvarying
society.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>looks vexed at this speech</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>But people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be
observed in them forever.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>turns and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>with surprise and interest</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Then you are a student of character, Miss Elizabeth. It must be an
amusing study<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Lizzy always likes to watch people. [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>.] And there
are plenty of people about, even if you do live in the country. The
country is a vast deal pleasanter than London, is not it, Mr. Bingley?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>When I am in the country I never wish to leave it, and when I am in town
it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages and I am
equally happy in either.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Ay&mdash;that is because <i>you</i> have the right disposition. [<i>Looking at</i>
<span class="smcap">Darcy</span>.] But that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at
all.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken. You quite mistook Mr.
Darcy. He only meant that there is not such a variety of people to be
met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be
true.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, my dear, nobody said there was&mdash;but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>As all become embarrassed at this speech</i>, <span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>comes to the
rescue</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Yes, there are many fine estates hereabout. Can you see Sir William
Lucas' place from the garden? I am not quite sure I have placed it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, there is a fine view of the chimneys from the terrace. Sir
William is our nearest neighbour. Such an agreeable man&mdash;so genteel, and
so easy&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Rising, she goes toward the glass doors.</i>] Come, Jane, we
must show Mr. Bingley Sir William's chimneys.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>, <span class="smcap">Bingley</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>go out upon the terrace</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling mischievously.</i>] Would not you also like to see the chimneys,
Mr. Darcy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Thank you. Like yourself, I prefer people to places.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Did I say that?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Not precisely. But I have drawn that conclusion.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gathering her sewing materials, begins to embroider.</i>] Well, I can
laugh at people better than places, and I dearly love a laugh<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Isn't that rather a dangerous trait, Miss Bennet? The wisest and the
best of men may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Certainly. But I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Whims and
inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.
[<i>Mischievously.</i>] But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are
without.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my
life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding
to ridicule.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>And in your list of weaknesses do you include such faults as vanity and
pride, for instance?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Yes, vanity is a weakness, indeed, but <i>pride</i>, where there is a real
superiority of mind&mdash;pride will be always under good regulation.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I am perfectly convinced, Mr. Darcy, that you have no defect<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I have made no such pretension, Miss Bennet. I have faults enough. My
temper I dare not vouch for. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others against myself. My good opinion once lost is lost forever.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>That is a failing, indeed. Implacable resentment <i>is</i> a shade in a
character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at
it. You are safe from me.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil&mdash;a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>And your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] And yours to wilfully misunderstand them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Voices are heard outside.</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>applies herself to her

terrace</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>The surrounding country is really charming, Mrs. Bennet<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p><i>We</i> think so. But you must give us a ball at Netherfield, Mr. Bingley,
and then you will see that some of the people who live here are worth
knowing.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Distressed.</i>] Oh, mamma!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Mamma!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, Mrs. Bennet. I had already decided upon it. I told Mr. Darcy
only yesterday that as soon as my sister, Miss Bingley, arrived, and
Nicholas could make white soup enough, I should send out my cards. Did
not I, Darcy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very stiffly.</i>] I believe you did.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, that is vastly good in you, Mr. Bingley; and then, perhaps, your
friend may change his mind about the country. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>.] You didn't
come to admire Sir William's chimneys, Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I was admiring your daughter's work, Madam<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you should see Jane's work. Lizzy is all for books, like her father.
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else. Jane, show
your embroidered parrot to Mr. Bingley.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>I do not think Mr. Bingley would be interested, ma'am.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Eagerly.</i>] Oh, indeed, I should, Miss Bennet; I am very much
interested in parrots.&mdash;Pray show it to me.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, and the new hand-screen. I will find it for you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>All three withdraw, leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>together</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>And so you are a great reader and take no pleasure in anything else?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Mamma does not understand. I deserve neither such praise nor such
censure. I am <i>not</i> a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>So I should have thought<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at the screen which he holds in his hand.</i>]</p>

<p>It is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very
accomplished as they are; to think how you all paint tables and cover
screens and net purses. It is quite wonderful.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Do you agree with your friend, Mr. Darcy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>His list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth. But
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen young ladies in the
whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished
woman.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps. To deserve the word, a woman must have a thorough knowledge of
music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages. She must
also possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking&mdash;the
tone of her voice&mdash;her address and expression, and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial&mdash;[<i>With a little bow to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.]
in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six
accomplished women! I rather wonder at your knowing any.</p>

<p>[<i>The gentlemen enter, smiling.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Here I am again, Mrs. Bennet. I found that Colonel Forster had a message
for the young ladies.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to see you. You are just in time to meet our new

<p>[<i>Looking distressed, speaks hurriedly.</i>] Oh, Mrs. Bennet, I'm sorry
that we cannot wait for Mr. Bennet. We&mdash;we&mdash;were on the way to meet my
steward&mdash;and we are already late for the appointment.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Effusively.</i>] I am very sorry you must go, Mr. Bingley. But I hope you
will come again. We must engage you soon for dinner.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>You may well be surprised, Miss Elizabeth, at this assertion after
seeing the very cold manner of our meeting just now. [<i>After a pause.</i>]
Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>No. Though I have heard of him, I met him for the first time to-day, but
even on this short acquaintance I should take him to be an ill-tempered
man.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As if he had come to a sudden decision.</i>] Miss Elizabeth, you have
been a witness of Mr. Darcy's treatment of me to-day, and therefore I
feel that I must, for my own justification, acquaint you with the facts
of my past connection with him<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I shall respect your confidence, Mr. Wickham.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I am sure of it. [<i>After a short pause.</i>] Mr. Darcy and I were born in
the same parish. My own father, who, to be frank, was steward of the
Darcy estates, gave up everything to serve the interests of the Darcy
family. Mr. Darcy's father was excessively attached to me:&mdash;indeed, I
was his godson. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had
done so. I was destined for the church and Mr. Darcy's father left to me
a most valuable living. But the present Mr. Darcy chose to ignore his
father's will and gave the living to another man. This closed for me the
career for which I was most fitted and left me with almost no means of
support.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens! But how could that be? Why did not you seek legal redress?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>There was an informality in the terms of the will which gave me no hope
from the law. Mr. Darcy's father had relied implicitly upon the honour
of his son.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>But&mdash;this is quite shocking. Mr. Darcy deserves to be publicly
disgraced<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Sometime or other he will be, but not by me. Till I can forget his
father, I can never defy or expose him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>This feeling does you honour. But what can have induced Mr. Darcy to
behave so cruelly?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I must attribute it in some measure to his jealousy. His father's
uncommon attachment to me irritated him, but the fact is, Miss
Elizabeth, as you can see, we are very different men, and he hates me.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>His disposition must be dreadful.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>I will not trust myself on that subject.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>To treat in such a manner the godson&mdash;the friend&mdash;the favourite of his
father! How abominable!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>And yet, Miss Elizabeth, we must try to be just to him. Mr. Darcy has
many good qualities. He can be both liberal and generous. He has also a
brother's affection and pride which makes him a careful guardian of his
sister<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he has a sister?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Yes. You will hear him cried up as the most attentive and best of
brothers. Oh, Mr. Darcy can please when he chooses. Among those who are
his equals he is a very different man from what he is to the less
prosperous.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Contemptible!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Forster.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Wickham!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting.</i>] Yes, Colonel Forster.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Forster.</span></p>

<p>I fear we must be going.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hurriedly to Elizabeth.</i>] Thank you for listening to me. It is hard to
be misjudged.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your confidence. It is well to know the truth<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Forster.</span></p>

<p>Well, Miss Elizabeth, I hope we shall see you all at your aunt's on
Wednesday. Good morning. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] Good morning, Miss Bennet. Thank
you for the music. Please present my respects to Mrs. Bennet. I am sorry
that we cannot wait longer.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Effusively.</i>] Yes, Miss Bennet, be sure to give your mother my best
regards. Good morning&mdash;[<i>All bow and curtsy. As he is leaving he speaks
aside.</i>] Oh, Miss Elizabeth, may I entreat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>You may depend upon my sympathy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at her with an understanding smile.</i>] I am most grateful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The gentlemen go out of the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>go into
the recess and look from the window. There is a short pause.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Enters, flurried, and looks about her.</i>] Well, have they gone?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>enters through the glass doors at the center. He
sees</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Madam, I am just returned from attending on Mr. Darcy. Such a
privilege! He was most condescending. I was able to tell him that Lady
Catherine was very well on Saturday sennight. He is very like Lady
Catherine. I am sure you must have been impressed by his distinguished
manners.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, really, Mr. Collins!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>A titter is heard from the recess where the girls are seated, and
then</i> <span class="smcap">Jane's</span> <i>voice</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Lizzy, hush!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hearing this, turns and discovers the two girls. Then he speaks to</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>with lowered voice, as if an idea had just come to him</i>.]
This meeting is most opportune. Will you kindly step this way for a
moment? [<i>He draws</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>aside</i>.] May I hope, Madam, for your
interest with your fair daughter Jane, in the matter on which we were
speaking yesterday? I would solicit the honour of a private audience
with her this morning.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, Mr. Collins. [<i>Hesitating.</i>] But there have been some changes
since then. Some things have happened<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>&mdash;I think it is right you should
know, that&mdash;that Jane is very likely to be soon engaged.
[<i>Encouragingly.</i>] But there is Elizabeth. I cannot take it upon myself
to say&mdash;I cannot possibly answer&mdash;but I do not know of any prepossession
in her case, and I am sure she can have no objection to listen to you.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>goes to the fire and stirs it</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As soon as she has finished.</i>] Then Miss Elizabeth let it be, Madam. I
was struck by her attitude of respectful awe when I mentioned the Lady
Catherine de Bourg. Such modesty and humility of mind cannot but
recommend her to my patroness.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking rather astonished at this last speech, but recovering
herself.</i>] Yes, my daughter Elizabeth knows what is proper. She will be
very happy to listen to you. Shall I call her now?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>I think, Madam, there should be no further loss of time, as my leave of
absence extends only to the coming Saturday.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Very well&mdash;[<i>She goes to the recess where the two girls are talking
together.</i>] Jane, I want you upstairs. Lizzy, Mr. Collins has something
he wishes to say to you<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Suspicious and dismayed.</i>] Dear ma'am, Mr. Collins must excuse me. I
was just going away myself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Now, no nonsense, Lizzy! I desire you will stay. Mr. Collins has
something <i>very</i> particular to say to you. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>tries to
escape</i>.] Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.
Come, Jane&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>go out</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Approaching</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <i>who does not move from the place where her
mother left her</i>.] Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, your modesty so
far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections.
But allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's
permission for this address. [<i>He escorts</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>with clumsy
gallantry to the sofa, then brings a chair and seats himself opposite to
her</i>. <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>has recovered herself sufficiently to begin to enjoy
the humour of the situation</i>.] My fair cousin, you must have at least
surmised that I am about to ask you to become the companion of my life.
And perhaps I had better begin by stating my reasons for this decision
before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>is
so overcome with laughter at this idea that she can hardly speak, or
keep a decent countenance</i>.<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I beg, Mr. Collins&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>One moment. My reasons for marrying are, first,&mdash;that I think it a right
thing for every clergyman to set the example of matrimony to his parish;
second, I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; third,
it is the particular advice of that very noble lady whom I have the
honour of calling patroness.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With more command of her voice.</i>] Believe me, Mr. Collins&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Excuse me&mdash;one moment. It remains only to be told why my views were
directed to Longbourn instead of to my own neighbourhood. The fact is
that, being as I am to inherit this estate after the death of your
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event took place. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter
myself it will not sink me in your esteem.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Collins,&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a></p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising and approaching nearer to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Still one moment more!
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you, in the most animated
language, of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly
indifferent, and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach on
that score shall ever pass my lips when we are married.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising in her turn.</i>] You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have
made no answer. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I
am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible
for me to do otherwise than decline them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With another formal wave of the hand.</i>] I am not unmindful of the fact
that sometimes a young lady's refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have
just said, and I shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Upon my word, sir, your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my
declaration! You must pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I
wish you very happy, and very rich, and, by refusing your hand, do all
in my power<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a> to prevent your being otherwise. This matter may be
considered, therefore, as definitely settled.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She is about to leave the room when</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>detains her</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>One moment. When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this
subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Becoming angry.</i>] Really, Mr. Collins, you puzzle me exceedingly. I
know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of
its being one.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusals of my address are merely words, of course. I shall choose to
attribute them to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according
to the usual practice of elegant females.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very decidedly.</i>] Please do not consider me now as an 'elegant
female'; I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed
sincere. To accept your proposal is absolutely impossible. Can I speak
plainer<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With awkward gallantry.</i>] You are uniformly charming; but I am
persuaded that when my proposals are sanctioned by both your parents
they will not fail of being acceptable. Meanwhile I may perhaps best
serve my cause by leaving you to consider the matter by yourself for a
while.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He bows and withdraws to the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>with a gesture as
if she gave the whole matter up in despair, and yet half amused,
goes to the fireplace. Just as</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>reaches the door</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Bennet</span> <i>opens it</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, Mr. Collins, are we to congratulate each other? [<i>Looking
doubtfully at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Has all gone as you could wish?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>I have every reason to be satisfied, Madam. My cousin has indeed
steadily refused this, my first offer, and with considerable warmth, but
this refusal would naturally flow from her bashful modesty. With your
influence behind me, I have no doubt of my ultimate success.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you may depend upon me, Mr. Collins. I will speak to Lizzy myself
directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl and does not know her
own interest. But I will make her know it<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Alarmed.</i>] Pardon me, Madam, but if she is really headstrong and
foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable
wife to a man in my situation. If, therefore, Miss Elizabeth persists in
rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into
accepting me.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Alarmed in her turn.</i>] Sir, you quite misunderstand me. Lizzy is only
headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. Let me see her alone for a moment.
That will be the best.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>But Madam&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Almost forcing</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>out of the room</i>.] Oh, I shall very soon
settle it with her, I am sure. [<span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>goes out</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>
<i>goes quickly to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Lizzy, what is the meaning of all this?
Have you refused Mr. Collins?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, mamma, but please listen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Angrily.</i>] No, I will not listen. I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you
take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this
way, you will never get a husband<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a> at all. I am going at once to the
library and speak to your father. You will listen <i>to him</i> perhaps.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>starts to go when she sees</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet</span> <i>outside

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, there he is now! [<i>She runs to the door, and opens it.</i>] Oh, Mr.
Bennet&mdash;Mr. Bennet! [<span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet</span> <i>turns</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span> <i>runs out, takes
him by the arm, and tries to pull him into the room by main force</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr.

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>While she draws</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet</span> <i>into the room</i>.] Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are
wanted immediately. We are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and, if you
do not make haste, Mr. Collins will change his mind and not have <i>her</i>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I have not the pleasure of understanding you. Of what are you talking?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy! Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say he will not have Lizzy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Lizzy? I thought it was Jane<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;no&mdash;It's Lizzy now!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Ah! And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Speak to Lizzy. There she is. [<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>at the
fireplace</i>.] Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Come here, child. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>goes to her
father</i>.] This is an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins
has made you an offer of marriage. Is this true?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;papa&mdash;it&mdash;is.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Very well&mdash;and this offer of marriage you have refused.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I have, sir.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting him.
Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, or I will never see her again!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day, you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again, if you do <i>not</i> marry Mr. Collins; and <i>I</i> will never see you
again if you <i>do</i>.</p>

<p>Love laughs at bars, Darcy! [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>looks annoyed</i>.] No,&mdash;I won't! It
really is not fair, since it is my fault. You would never have been put
to this test if you hadn't been so good as to stay on here with me after
that&mdash;&mdash;<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a></p>

<p>[<i>Stopping suddenly, and with an entire change from his former bantering
tone, he says in a hesitating manner.</i>] Darcy, do you really think you
should be silent about Wickham?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Haughtily.</i>] Decidedly! I do not choose to lay my private affairs
before the world.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>But the fellow is sailing under false colours. You do not know what the
result may be. I really must speak of this again, Darcy, even at the
risk of offending you. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>makes an impatient gesture</i>.] I am truly
concerned at the foothold this rascal has already gained in the Bennet
family. What he has failed to accomplish once he may succeed in again.
These young ladies have no brother to defend them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Neither have they the wealth to excite Wickham's cupidity. At any rate I
do not wish to be the one to enlighten the neighbourhood. Besides, I
understand that he has left Meryton.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Even so&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; [<i>He is interrupted by</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Bingley</span>, <i>who enters gaily
from the drawing-room</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Ah! Here you are! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>.] Will you be so<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a> kind? [<i>She holds out
her arm for him to clasp her bracelet.</i>] Your sister Georgiana should be
here, Mr. Darcy. [<i>To her brother.</i>] Charles, you should have insisted
on her coming.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>I am not in the habit of insisting with Darcy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughingly.</i>] Very true. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>, <i>who has at length succeeded in
fastening the bracelet</i>.] Thank you. [<i>Looking about her.</i>] It is vastly
pretty, Charles, but I am much mistaken if there are not some among us
to whom a ball will be rather a punishment than a pleasure.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] If you mean Darcy, he may go to bed, if he pleases, before
it begins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>But, Charles, it would certainly be more rational if conversation
instead of dancing were made the order of the day.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Much more rational, my dear Caroline, but it would not be near so much
like a ball.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Martin, the Footman.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering, to</i> <span class="smcap">Bingley</span>.] Several of the carriages have<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a> arrived, sir,

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Footman</span>.] Very well. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Bingley</span>.] Come Caroline, we
must be at our post. We will leave Darcy to make up his mind whether he
will join us later.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>and his sister disappear through the archway leading to

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

Why did not I have more presence of mind!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>I dare say you will find him very agreeable.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all. To find a
man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn't be a simpleton, Eliza. You are angry because Wickham is not
here, but I wouldn't allow my fancy for him to make me unpleasant in the
eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>My <i>fancy</i> for Wickham, as you choose to call it, is simply my sympathy
for a most ill-used man: also the relief of meeting with good manners
and a good understanding after the insufferable pride of Mr. Darcy, and
the stupid pomposity of that <i>dreadful</i> Mr. Collins! [<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span><a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>
<i>starts</i>.] Oh, my dear Charlotte, I have never thanked you half enough
for helping us to endure that man. It was so good-natured in you to
sacrifice yourself by listening to those interminable speeches of
his.&mdash;I am more obliged to you than I can express. But oh, what a relief
it is to know that he is really gone!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has listened to all this tirade in increasing embarrassment.</i>] Oh,
don't! Don't, Eliza! You are making it so terribly hard for me.
But,&mdash;but I must tell you.&mdash;I am engaged to Mr. Collins!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>is stupefied with surprise and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>for

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Engaged! Engaged to&mdash;to Mr. Collins! Oh, my dear
Charlotte&mdash;<i>impossible</i>! [<i>Hopefully.</i>] You are joking!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With spirit.</i>] No, indeed, Eliza, I am in most serious earnest. Why
should you be so surprised? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins
should be able to procure <i>any</i> woman's good opinion, because he was not
so happy as to succeed with you?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Confused.</i>] Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;of course not. And,&mdash;and<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a> you must forgive all
I have just said. I couldn't possibly have imagined&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>More sweetly.</i>] No, Eliza, indeed you could not. [<i>She puts her hand
on</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth's</span> <i>shoulder</i>.] And we shall be friends still?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Why, of course, of course, dear Charlotte. It was only the&mdash;the
surprise. You know how fond I am of you. You know I wish you all
imaginable happiness.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I am sure of it. You must be surprised&mdash;very much surprised, so
lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But, dear Eliza, when
you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied
with what I have done. I am not romantic. I ask only a comfortable home,
and, considering Mr. Collins' situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In an absent manner.</i>] Undoubtedly.</p>

<p>Oh yes, Colonel Forster.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She goes out with</i> <span class="smcap">Forster</span>, <i>leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>alone, still

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I think we are being treated abominably ill, Lizzy! It seems that Mr.

all. [<span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>looks off toward the ball-room</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Suddenly.</i>] Why, Mr. Denny&mdash;I do believe the reel is<a name="page_070" id="page_070"></a> half over&mdash;I

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>makes no answer</i>.]</p>

<p>Do not you enjoy the reel, Miss Bennet?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking up.</i>] Oh, I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say&mdash;"Yes,"
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing that kind of scheme. I have therefore made up my
mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now
despise me, if you dare!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I do not dare.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Approaching</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>.] I can guess the subject of your reverie.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I should imagine not.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>You are considering how insufferable it would be to pass many evenings
in such society. Indeed, I am quite of your opinion. I was never more
annoyed. The insipidity<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a> and yet the noise;&mdash;the nothingness and yet the
self-importance of all these people! What would I give to hear your
strictures on them!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Your conjecture is totally wrong. I assure you, my mind was more
agreeably engaged. I was meditating on the very great pleasure which a
pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him very meaningly and sweetly, speaks with coquetry.</i>]
Indeed! And will not you tell me what lady has the credit of inspiring
such reflections?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With great intrepidity.</i>] Miss Elizabeth Bennet.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taken aback.</i>] Miss Elizabeth Bennet! I am all astonishment! How long
has she been such a favourite? Pray when am I to wish you joy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
imagination is very rapid: it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Nay, if you are so serious about it I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law! Of course
she will always be at Pemberley with you. Perhaps you might give her a
few hints as to the advantage of holding her tongue.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Thank you. Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes! Let the portrait of your uncle, the attorney, be placed next to
your great uncle, the Judge. They are in the same profession, you know,
only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not
attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those
beautiful eyes!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Oh, I fear not&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel Forster</span>,

<p>I thought this next dance was the one you liked so much, Darcy. Let me

<p>[<i>Starting, as if from a reverie.</i>.] So it is. Thank you&mdash;I have a
partner.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <i>bows, and they go into the ball-room

<p>[<i>Looking after</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>with a smile, turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] You must be
tired, Miss Bennet. I propose that we sit quietly through this dance. Do
you agree?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Yes, indeed. [<i>She sits on the bench.</i>] It will be very pleasant.
[<i>Looking about her.</i>] How very prettily you have arranged all the
rooms, Mr. Bingley<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>I am so glad you think so. I feared they were rather inconvenient for so
large a party.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I find them delightful!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>You are always charitable, Miss Bennet. It seems to me you always manage
to see the best side of everything. I never knew you to say an ill word
about a person or a place.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Oh, I fear that is not quite exact. I only try to see
things in their best light, perhaps.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p>That is just it. The rest of us rarely try to see things in that way. So
you see I have proved my case. You are too amiable.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Not for to-night, Mr. Bingley. Everybody is of one mind to-night. There
is but one point of view&mdash;you are giving nothing but pleasure.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Bingley.</span></p>

<p><a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>[<i>Soberly.</i>] I wish it were so&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; [<i>With impulsive earnestness.</i>]
Dear Miss Bennet, I wish to tell you&mdash;I must tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the
dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
rooms, or the number of couples.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I assure you I will say whatever you wish.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Very well, that reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Do you talk by rule then?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know,&mdash;and yet for the advantage
of some, conversation ought to be so arranged that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Archly.</i>] Both, for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn
of our minds; we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition,
unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze
the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the <i>éclat</i> of a
proverb.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure.
How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a
faithful portrait, undoubtedly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I shall not decide on my own performance. [<i>There is a short silence;
then, as if with an effort</i>, <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>speaks</i>.] I am surprised not to
see Mr. Wickham here to-night. I find that he is a great favourite with
the officers. He has made many friends among them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With great hauteur.</i>] Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may insure his <i>making</i> friends; whether he may be equally capable of
<i>retaining</i> them is less certain<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Excitedly.</i>] He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, and in
a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.</p>

<p>[<i>They are both silent.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Sir William Lucas.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming up to them all urbanity and smiles.</i>] What a charming amusement
for young people this dancing is, Mr. Darcy! I consider it as one of the
first refinements of polished societies.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, sir, and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Sir William.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Do you often dance at St. James?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Never, sir.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Sir William.</span></p>

<p>You have a house in town, I conclude.</p>

<p>I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself: but<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a> I did not feel
quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Darcy</span> <i>bows in silence again</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>is amused</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Sir William.</span></p>

<p>But I must not further interrupt you, sir! I only wish to tell you once
more how highly gratified I have been by your superior dancing; allow me
also to say that your fair partner does not disgrace you. It is a great
pleasure to see you together. I must hope to&mdash;to have this pleasure
often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss
Eliza, [<i>Glancing at</i> <span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>, <i>who are talking earnestly
together at the back of the scene</i>.] shall take place. What
congratulations will then flow in: but let me not interrupt you&mdash;you
will not thank me, Mr. Darcy, for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Murmurs to himself.</i>] So! [<i>Looking earnestly at</i> <span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>,
<i>he seems much impressed by what</i> <span class="smcap">Sir William</span> <i>has said</i>. <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
<i>notices this. Recovering himself</i>, <span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>turns to her again</i>.] Sir
William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people who had less to<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a> say for themselves. We have
tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to
talk of next, I cannot imagine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] What think you of books?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Books? Oh no: I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I am sorry you think so, but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions of them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>No, I cannot talk of books at a ball&mdash;my head is always full of
something else.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>The present always occupies you in such scenes, does it?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In an absent manner.</i>] Yes, always. [<i>Suddenly.</i>] I remember hearing
you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave; that your
resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I
suppose, as to its being created?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Firmly.</i>] I am<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I hope not.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to
be secure of judging properly at first.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>May I ask to what these questions lead?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Merely to the illustration of your character. I am trying to make it
out.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>And what is your success?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking her head.</i>] I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] I can readily believe that reports may vary greatly with
respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to
sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear
that the performance would reflect no credit on either<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>But if I do not take your likeness now I may never have another
opportunity.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very stiffly.</i>] I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Miss Bingley</span> <i>enters from the ball-room. She comes directly to</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Darcy&mdash;would you be so good as to go to Charles? He wishes very
much to consult with you about some of the table arrangements. You will
find him in the dining-parlour. [<i>With exaggerated politeness to</i>
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] That is, if Miss Bennet will permit you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Carelessly.</i>] Oh, certainly.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>bows and goes out</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <i>after a moment's silence</i>.] So, Miss Bennet, I hear
that you are quite delighted with George Wickham. He must have told you
all a pretty tale. As to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly
false. I do not know the particulars, but I do know that George Wickham
has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. His coming into the
county at all is a most insolent thing.<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a> I feel very strongly on this
point, Miss Bennet, as Mr. Darcy's interests are so intimately
associated with our own. [<i>She watches</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] We hope Miss
Georgiana Darcy may some day be my sister. My brother admires her
greatly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With indifference.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>Yes, and therefore we resent these falsehoods and this presumption on
the part of George Wickham. But, really, considering his descent, we
could not expect much better. He has evidently forgotten to tell you
that he is the son of old Wickham, steward to the late Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Angrily.</i>] His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the
same. I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son
of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of <i>that</i>, I can assure you, he informed me
himself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Miss Bingley.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sneer.</i>] Oh! I beg your pardon. Excuse my interference; it was
kindly meant.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Insolent girl! You are much mistaken if you expect<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a> to influence me by
such a paltry attack at this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful
ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Footmen</span> <i>now come in with small tables, which they place about the

<p>[To <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <span class="smcap">Jane</span>, <i>his sister, and others who have entered</i>.] I

have you heard the news? Mr. Denny has just told me that the regiment is
to leave Meryton, and go to Brighton! Good heavens! What is to become of
us, mamma?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sympathetically.</i>] Are they really going? Well, my love, it <i>is</i> too
bad! I know how you feel. I am sure I<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a> cried for two days together when
Colonel Millar's regiment went away, five-and-twenty years ago. I
thought I should have broken my heart.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>I am sure I shall break mine. [<i>Coaxingly.</i>] Mamma, might we not <i>all</i>
go to Brighton?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if we only could! But I fear your father will not hear of it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, papa is so disagreeable! I am sure a little sea-bathing would set me
up forever! Wouldn't it, Mr. Denny?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Denny.</span></p>

<p>Surely, Miss Lydia. Oh, you must manage it in some way.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They move off and take their places at one of the tables.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking after them.</i>] Well, Lady Lucas, it is hard for a lively young
girl like my Lydia to be cooped up in a place where there is so little
going on. However, [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Bingley</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] we are not likely
to have it so very dull in the future. [<i>In a loud whisper to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
Lucas</span>.] You know what I mean&mdash;[<i>Nudging her and laughing.</i>] Jane and
Bingley<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Lucas.</span></p>

<p>Ah! Indeed!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With importance and in a still louder tone.</i>] Oh, yes! It's quite
settled. Such a charming young man&mdash;and Netherfield only three miles
from Longbourn! And Jane's marrying will be a fine thing for my other
girls. They will be sure to meet other rich men who will fall in love
with them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has heard the beginning of this conversation, makes a pretext to
go to arrange her mother's scarf and says in low tones.</i>] Oh, mamma! Be
careful, I beg. Mr. Darcy can hear you!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure
we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing
<i>he</i> may not like to hear!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In distress.</i>] For heaven's sake, Madam, speak lower! What advantage
can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself
to his friend by so doing.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>That is enough, Lizzy! I think I can take care of myself. I never knew
before that it was a crime to speak<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a> to one's friends about what
everybody can see plainly enough, who has eyes in his head. [<i>Turning
to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir William</span>.] Did <i>you</i>, Sir William?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Sir William.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Our friends usually have very sharp eyes for what is going
on, Mrs. Bennet! [<i>Significantly.</i>] I have, indeed, sometimes expected
that <i>you</i> would observe what has been going on in our own household of
late.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

satisfaction in the recent engagement of our daughter, Charlotte.</p>

<p>Well, really, Mrs. Bennet!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Sir William.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Offended.</i>] What I have told you is quite true, nevertheless, Mrs.

Hunsford. I am sorry we are not to receive your good wishes.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>The parlour of</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins's</span> <i>parsonage at Hunsford. At the back
of the room is an open door. This door leads directly into the
garden, beyond which is seen, through an opening in the trees of
the park opposite, "the prospect of Rosings"&mdash;the residence of</i>
<span class="smcap">Lady Catherine de Bourg</span>&mdash;"<i>a handsome, modern building on rising
ground." A wide cottage window, also at the back of the room, gives
a plain view of the passers-by. On either side of the parlour is a
door, leading to other parts of the house.</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>is
discovered standing at the open door and looking up at some one
outside who is evidently climbing the trellis</i>.</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">A Voice</span> (<i>outside.</i>)</p>

<p>Is this the cluster you wish, Miss Bennet?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Mischievously.</i>] No, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Those are buds; the ones
higher still. There&mdash;by the eaves.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>laughingly watches</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam</span> <i>until he
appears with a cluster of half opened roses, which he presents to
her with a gallant air</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking the roses and putting them in her girdle.</i>]</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>May not I have <i>one</i>, as my reward, Miss Bennet?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Is not accomplishment its own reward?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>And is not the power to be generous the highest reward that can be given
to any accomplishment?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, surely! And so <i>you</i> would have to be generous and get me some more
roses: then we should each of us have to invent new speeches, and so we
should never be done till we were ready to print a phrase book. However,
you have certainly won your rose. [<i>She gives it to him.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>Thank you! That phrase-book is a capital idea, Miss Bennet. Nothing
could please me better than just such an occupation. It would really be
a charity, for Darcy is such a dull fellow these days that I really
don't know what to do with myself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>But we should hardly have the time for such a project.<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a> You say that you
and Mr. Darcy are to leave Lady Catherine on Saturday.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>Yes, if Darcy doesn't put it off again. He has already paid our aunt a
much longer visit than ever before. I am at his disposal, you know. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he
pleases than Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>He likes to have his own way very well, but so do we all. It is only
that he has better means of having it than many others. [<i>Looking at his
watch.</i>] I suppose I ought to go and look for him now. I expected to
find him here, [<i>With a meaning smile.</i>] as not unfrequently happens.
But since he is not, he probably expects me to meet him at the
Crossroads.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But perhaps his sister does as well
for the present,&mdash;and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;that is an advantage which he must share with me. I am joined with
him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage. And, if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam</span> <i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>very suspiciously as she
makes this last remark</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>Why&mdash;what?&mdash;Why do you suppose Miss Darcy is likely to give us any
uneasiness, Miss Bennet?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Carelessly.</i>] Oh, nothing at all! You need not be frightened! I never
heard any harm of her; she is a great favourite with a lady of my
acquaintance&mdash;Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you knew
Miss Bingley.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>I know her a little. Her brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike man. He is
a great friend of Darcy's.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes. Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley and takes a
prodigious deal of care of him<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>Care of him? Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him. From
something he has told me, I have reason to think Bingley very much
indebted to him. [<i>Stopping.</i>] But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have
no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Curiously, and with ill-concealed anxiety.</i>] What is it you mean?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>It is a circumstance which, of course, Darcy could not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family it
would be an unpleasant thing.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>You may depend upon my not mentioning it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>And, remember, that I haven't much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without names or any other particulars, and I
only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him to be the kind of
young man to get into a scrape of that sort.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to suppress her feeling.</i>] Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons
for this interference<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Indeed! [<i>Trying to speak calmly.</i>] And what arts did he use to separate
them?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] He did not talk to me of his own arts. He only told <i>me</i>,
what I have now told <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Why was your cousin to be the judge?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Growing excited.</i>] I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on
the propriety of his friend's inclination; why, upon his <i>own</i> judgment
alone, Mr. Darcy was to determine in what manner his friend was to be
happy. [<i>Recovering herself.</i>] But as we know none of the particulars,
it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was
much affection in the case.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>That is not an unnatural surmise, and I believe Darcy<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a> told me that he
did not think that the lady, at least, was very deeply concerned in the
matter. However, to lessen the affection on either side is to lessen the
honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Your cousin's triumph&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Greatly excited, she is about to continue, when</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte's</span> <i>voice is
heard outside</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Darcy, I think I saw Colonel Fitzwilliam go up the garden path
a few moments ago. [<i>Protesting.</i>] Oh, no, Mr. Darcy, you are too kind!
Really&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Outside.</i>] Pray, allow me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>enters, accompanied by</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>, <i>who is carrying a
basket of eggs. She wears a garden hat and gloves.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Ah, here he is. Good morning, Colonel Fitzwilliam. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span>.] Pray
let me have the basket now, Mr. Darcy. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>gives</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>the
basket, and then turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Good morning, Miss Bennet. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>returns</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy's</span> <i>greeting with a
self-consciousness which does not<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a> escape his notice, but the motive of
which he mistakes</i>. <span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>gives a quick glance from</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>to</i>
<span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam</span>, <i>as he turns to speak to the latter</i>.] Ah,
Fitzwilliam, I thought I might find you here.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lightly.</i>] Yes, I have been so fortunate as to secure some of Mrs.
Collins's early roses for Miss Bennet.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In surprise.</i>] Really! Have they already opened?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has by this time recovered her self-possession.</i>] A very few of
them. But Colonel Fitzwilliam was obliged to climb very near to the sun
to get me these. [<i>She looks admiringly upon the flowers as she
speaks.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Showing the rose which</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>has given him</i>.]</p>

<p>And you see I have my reward.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling faintly.</i>] Colonel Fitzwilliam might not have won his prize so
easily, Miss Bennet, had there been others in the field.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Ah, no, Mr. Darcy, I cannot lessen Colonel Fitzwilliam's achievement by
admitting any such possibility<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gallantly.</i>] Thank you, Miss Bennet!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>turns away with an unconscious look of chagrin</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Well, surely, my roses will have to bloom their prettiest this season in
return for all the attention they have received. [<i>To the young men.</i>]
Will not you be seated, gentlemen?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Tartly.</i>] Thanks, no, Mrs. Collins; I merely stopped for Colonel
Fitzwilliam; but perhaps his rose-gathering has caused him to abandon
our project of taking a walk together this morning.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>By no means, Darcy, that pleasure has only been deferred.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Very good then. We will go at once, if Mrs. Collins and Miss Bennet will
pardon me this hasty call.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, Mr. Darcy! [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>also, absent-mindedly, murmurs her
assent, for which</i> <span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>lingers with vague uneasiness before departing
with</i> <span class="smcap">Fitzwilliam</span>. <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>curiously, then calls
to the little maid, who enters</i>.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Martha&mdash;take these eggs to the pantry. Do not disturb them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Martha.</span></p>

<p>Very well, ma'am.</p>

<p>[<i>She curtsies and goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking off her hat and gloves.</i>] Now, Eliza, we must get to our work
and have a comfortable chat. You have been here nearly two weeks and we
really haven't had a good talk yet.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Getting out her embroidery.</i>] Yes, you promised me a quiet visit,
Charlotte. But I find you are more lively here than we are at Longbourn.</p>

<p>[<i>The two ladies sit at the table with their embroidery.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>But how could I have anticipated the arrival here of two very attentive
young gentlemen? [<i>Smiling at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] It is really quite a
surprising coincidence, or else Mr. Darcy has timed his visit to his
aunt very cleverly. As to these daily visits to the parsonage&mdash;you may
be sure I do not take to myself the credit of them. Neither of these
young gentlemen would ever come so often to see me. I have to thank you,
Eliza, for this civility<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little temper.</i>] You may thank a lack of occupation on their
part. You know very well my opinion of Mr. Darcy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Yes. You have often expressed it. I wish I were as well informed of Mr.
Darcy's opinion of Eliza.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>When you know the one, you know the other. They are identical.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Well, perhaps under the circumstances, that is the most satisfactory
condition of things. And do we hold the same opinion of Colonel
Fitzwilliam?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Tossing her head.</i>] Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>sharply, and after a short silence</i>.] And so
Jane is once more at home after her visit in London, and Lydia has gone
to Brighton after all. How did she ever manage to persuade your father?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Lydia was so determined upon it that she and mamma gave my father no
peace till they had teased him to consent. But I am very sorry. Lydia is
too foolish,<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a> too ignorant and wilful to be trusted away from home. I
only hope that no harm will come of it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>And is Mr. Wickham still with the regiment?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, he went with it to Brighton.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>I hear that he is thinking of marrying Miss King, since she has just
received a legacy of ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think
that our friend was mercenary.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If Miss King does not object to
it, why should we?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p><i>Her</i> not objecting does not justify&mdash;him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Emphatically.</i>] Well, have it as you choose. <i>He</i> shall be mercenary,
and <i>she</i> shall be foolish! Mr. Wickham's worst fault, after all, is his
power of being agreeable. Thank heaven, we both of us know some men who
haven't one agreeable quality. Stupid men are the only ones worth
knowing<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Well, well, Eliza! That speech savours a little
of&mdash;disappointment.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes&mdash;anything you please!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Changing the subject.</i>] And you say that Jane is not in her usual
spirits?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shortly.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>And she is looking poorly?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Still more shortly.</i>] Yes&mdash;very!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Did she see much of the Bingleys in London?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bursting out hotly.</i>] She saw nothing of them. Oh, Charlotte, I have
just had all my suspicions verified.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Your suspicions?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, there has been an arrangement in all this. Mr.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a> Bingley has been
kept away from Jane by&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Stops suddenly.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looks up curiously, then speaks quickly.</i>] Don't imagine any such
nonsense, Eliza. A young man like Mr. Bingley so easily falls in love
with a pretty girl for a few weeks&mdash;and, when accident separates them,
so easily forgets her, that this sort of inconstancy is very frequent.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>We do not suffer from accident, Charlotte. A young man of independent
fortune does not suddenly decide of his own free will to think no more
of a girl with whom he was violently in love.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>But were they so violently in love?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;I never saw a more promising inclination. Why, Mr. Bingley would
talk to no one else&mdash;would look at no one else. Is not general
incivility the very essence of love?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] It is usually a good test. But if Jane did not return his
affection&mdash;&mdash; It really did not seem to me that there was anything
<i>violent</i> in Jane's attitude. I could never see that she showed any
extreme affection for Bingley<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hotly.</i>] Well, I know that Jane was very much in love with him, and
that she showed her affection as much as her nature would allow. If
Bingley didn't see it he must have been a simpleton. No&mdash;the real
trouble was that Jane didn't see him often enough, perhaps, to make her
understand his character.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Oh, if Jane were married to Bingley to-morrow, I should think she had as
good a chance of happiness as if she were studying him for a
twelve-month. It is far better to know as little as possible of the
person with whom you are to pass your life.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Demurely.</i>] In some cases that is undoubtedly true.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Appears at the garden door. He wears a wide-brimmed hat and carries a
hoe&mdash;also a large basket. He looks in.</i>] Ah! A very charming domestic
picture! [<i>Taking a bunch of radishes from the basket, he speaks to</i>
<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.] My dear, I have found some fine early radishes. I thought it
would be a graceful attention on your part to send some of these to Miss
de Bourg. [<i>He sits upon the chair near the doorway.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>I fear the apothecary might object<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>True&mdash;they might not be suitable, but [<i>Looking at them proudly.</i>] they
are very fine radishes. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Miss Elizabeth, I am very
successful in my gardening. I consider the work I do in my garden to be
one of my most respectable pleasures. Lady Catherine is always ready to
encourage me in it, and my dear Charlotte is ever willing that I should
leave her side for the sake of this healthful exercise. [<i>Looking at the
radishes again.</i>] It is, indeed, a pity that Miss de Bourg is not well
enough to enjoy them. My dear Charlotte has doubtless told you, Miss
Elizabeth, of the alliance which is in prospect between Miss de Bourg
and Mr. Darcy. This extreme delicacy of constitution would seem to be
the only bar to their happiness.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Charlotte has told me that Miss de Bourg is sickly. She will make
Mr. Darcy a very proper wife.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>looks anxiously at</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>says
this, but he is gazing out of the door and does not seem to notice
the remark</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>I hope you are pleased with Kent, Miss Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Very much, Mr. Collins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>I do not think the kingdom can boast a grander scene<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a> than the one now
spread before our eyes: [<i>Pointing.</i>] This garden&mdash;that park with
Rosings in the distance. Do not you think my dear Charlotte is most
fortunately placed, Miss Elizabeth?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Most fortunately, Mr. Collins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>And when you have seen Lady Catherine, you will be more deeply
impressed, I am sure. We can hardly expect her to call upon you. This
illness of Miss de Bourg would prevent it, and in any case it would be
an act of extreme condescension on her part; but I am quite confident
that you will receive an invitation to drink tea of a Sunday evening
with her, after Mr. Darcy and his cousin are gone, of course. And&mdash;we
may later have an invitation to dinner&mdash;although I would not for the

carriage is turning into the lane and <i>she</i> is in it!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising in great excitement</i>.] Lady Catherine&mdash;at this hour! What
amazing condescension! [<i>He turns in a helpless manner to</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.]
But, my dear, I am quite<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a> unprepared. My habiliments&mdash;I would not be
wanting in respect.&mdash;What shall I do?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hurriedly putting up her work and giving her hat and gloves to the

<p>Give it to Martha!</p>

<p>[<i>Holding out the basket.</i>] And these radishes, my dear?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Martha, take the radishes from Mr. Collins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Martha.</span></p>

<p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>The maid tries to hold at once&mdash;basket, hoe, hat, and gloves, as

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Again emerging from the door.</i>] Do not make yourself uneasy about your
own apparel, Miss Elizabeth; Lady Catherine is far from requiring that
elegance in us which becomes herself and daughter&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Oh, do go, Mr. Collins! Lady Catherine will be here in
an instant!</p>

<p>[<i>She shuts the door on</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Greatly amused at all this excitement.</i>] Are you going to make any
change in your dress, Charlotte? Do you wish me to do so?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Well, Eliza, if you wouldn't mind, I should like you to put on your
sprigged muslin. In spite of what Mr. Collins says, I know it would
please him. I have no time to change. Is my cap straight? Oh, here she
is. [<i>To the maid, who stands staring, with her arms full.</i>] Why,
Martha! Are you still there? Go! Go! [<i>She bustles the maid out of one
door, then runs to the other, calling her husband.</i>] Mr. Collins! Mr.
Collins!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She then rushes into the garden, followed immediately by</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>So, at last&mdash;her high and only mightiness! No tremors, Elizabeth! Now is
the time for all your courage. [<i>She runs laughing out of the room.</i>]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>Sounds of voices are heard, and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Catherine</span> <i>appears escorted

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As she reaches the door.</i>] You keep too many hens, Mrs. Collins. There
is just a certain number which are profitable&mdash;beyond that there is
waste. [<span class="smcap">Lady Catherine</span> <i>sits on the sofa</i>.] A clergyman's wife should
set an example of thrift. You should have asked my advice.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Collins will in the future regulate her poultry-yard according to
your directions, Lady Catherine, if you will be so condescending as to
give them.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Yes, thank you, Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Will your Ladyship not take some refreshment?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes&mdash;let me fetch you a cup of tea<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>No, no&mdash;I wish nothing. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span>.] But you may go, Mr. Collins,
and see if Jones is walking the horses up and down. I do not trust
Jones.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>With great pleasure, your Ladyship. [<span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>goes out</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.] I thought you had a visitor, Mrs. Collins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Yes, your Ladyship&mdash;I have. It is my friend, Miss Elizabeth Bennet. She
is a cousin of Mr. Collins and a neighbour of ours in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I have heard about her. Fitzwilliam says she is a very genteel, pretty
kind of girl.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pleased.</i>] Indeed she is, Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Well, where is she?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>She has gone to make a little change in her dress, before presenting
herself to your Ladyship<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh! very proper&mdash;very proper!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>I am delighted to hear that Miss de Bourg is better, Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Yes, thank you. She is very greatly improved. [<i>After a slight pause,
with impatience</i>.] Well, Miss Bennet takes her time!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Anxiously.</i>] I am sure she will be here in a moment. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
<i>enters</i>.] Oh, here she is. [<i>Presenting</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Lady Catherine,
Miss Elizabeth Bennet. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>curtsies</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Without leaving her seat, looks</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>over from head to foot</i>.]
Oh, how do you do, Miss Bennet. You are younger than I thought!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Indeed?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You know my nephew, Mr. Darcy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I met him in Hertfordshire<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Humph! And you know Colonel Fitzwilliam?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I have only met Colonel Fitzwilliam since coming here.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Humph! Has your governess left you?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Half laughs.</i>] My sisters and I have never had a governess, Madam.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>No governess! I never heard of such a thing! Your mother must have been
quite a slave to your education.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I assure you she was not, Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Then who taught you? Without a governess you must have been neglected.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means, Madam.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Well, if I had known your mother, I should have advised<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a> her most
strenuously to engage a governess. I should have seen to it myself.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.] Go on with your work, Mrs. Collins. A clergyman's wife
should set an example of industry. [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte's</span> <i>embroidery
with disapproval</i>.] I will send you some more of the parish petticoats
to hem, Mrs. Collins. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Go on with your work, Miss
Bennet. Young ladies should never be idle. [<i>Both</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>go on with their embroidery. Looking hard at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.]
Pray what is your age, Miss Bennet?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I am not one and twenty.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You have sisters, have not you?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Madam.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Are any of them out?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>All, Madam.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What! All out at once? Very odd! Out before the oldest is married<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Really, Madam, I think it would be very hard on the younger sisters not
to have their share of society because the eldest one does not happen to
be married. That would hardly be likely to promote sisterly affection,
or delicacy of mind.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a
person! Your sisters may be married before you. You must not be too
ambitious. A good many young girls have lost their chances through being
too ambitious. [<i>Looking at a large picture on the wall and then
pointing to it.</i>] Mrs. Collins, I suppose you have shown Miss Bennet
this print of Pemberley&mdash;Mr. Darcy's place?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Complacently.</i>] Pemberley is one of the finest places in England. My
daughter Anne is very fond of it, which is fortunate, since she will
probably spend the most of her life there.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>Most fortunate, your Ladyship.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] You see my nephews here often, Miss Bennet<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Mischievously.</i>] Yes, <i>very</i> often, Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Humph! Well, idle young gentlemen often make very foolish use of their
time. My daughter, Miss de Bourg, is unfortunately not able to accompany
Mr. Darcy in his walks as often as both of them could desire.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering.</i>] I think your Ladyship's mind may be quite at rest about
the horses. Jones seems to have them well in hand.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I am glad you have come back, Mr. Collins. I am going to ask you and
Mrs. Collins to go and see the new cottages with me. I shall take you in
the carriage. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.] You had better put on a plain bonnet,
Mrs. Collins.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>By all means, your Ladyship. [<i>She goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Are you quite ready to go, Mr. Collins?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Collins.</span></p>

<p>Oh&mdash;assuredly, your Ladyship&mdash;quite!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Miss Bennet, I should advise you to<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a> write to your
family while we are gone. [<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> <i>returns in her bonnet and mantle</i>.
<span class="smcap">Lady Catherine</span> <i>looks her over</i>.] Yes, that will do very well!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] We shall not be gone very long, Eliza.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I am not sure of that, Mrs. Collins, but I have provided an occupation
for Miss Bennet during our absence. Good morning, Miss Bennet. I may ask
you later for dinner.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Curtsying.</i>] Good morning, Madam. [<i>All go out</i>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Collins</span> <i>showing
servile attentions to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Catherine</span>. <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>watches them from the
door</i>.] Really! I might have spared myself some of the mortifications I
have felt for the shortcomings of my own family. The contrast is not
such a violent one after all. [<i>Looking at the writing desk.</i>] However,
Lady Catherine can give good advice. I really ought to write to my poor,
dear Jane.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She seats herself at the writing table&mdash;gets out her paper, etc.
and begins her letter when the door-bell sounds.</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>starts
and is putting away the writing materials, when the maid ushers in</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Darcy</span>, <i>who seems much excited</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I am here again, Miss Bennet. I saw Mr. and Mrs.<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a> Collins drive away
with my aunt. I have something which I <i>must</i> say to you. [<i>He walks
excitedly up and down for a moment, while</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>watches him in
amazed silence. Then he suddenly goes up to her and begins to speak in
an agitated manner.</i>] Miss Bennet&mdash;in vain have I struggled! It will not
do! My feelings will not be repressed! You must allow me to tell you how
ardently I admire and love you!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Is perfectly astounded. She stares, colours, doubts, and is silent.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking her silence for encouragement.</i>] Miss Bennet, I can well
understand your own astonishment at this declaration, for I am amazed at
myself! My feeling for you has taken possession of me against my will,
my reason, and almost against my character!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting in indignation.</i>] Sir!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, understand me, I beg of you! For yourself alone my admiration is
only too natural. I share it with everyone who has the happiness of
knowing you. But&mdash;pardon me&mdash;for it pains me to offend you&mdash;the defects
of your nearest relations, the total lack of propriety so frequently
betrayed by your family, has so opposed my judgment to<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a> my inclination,
that it has required the utmost force of passion on my part to put them
aside. But, my dear Miss Bennet, your triumph is complete. Your own
loveliness stands out the fairer in its contrast to your surroundings,
and I now hope that the strength of my love may have its reward in your
acceptance of my hand.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Who has gone through all sorts of emotions during this speech, speaks,
in a constrained manner as if trying to control herself.</i>] Mr. Darcy&mdash;in
such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a
sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they
may be returned. If I could feel gratitude I would now thank you. But I
cannot. I have never desired your good opinion, and <i>you</i> have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Leaning against the mantel-piece, hears her words with no less
resentment than surprise. After a little he speaks in a voice of forced
calmness.</i>] And that is all the reply which I am to have the honour of
expecting? I might perhaps wish to be informed why, with so little
endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small
importance.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I might as well inquire why, with so evident a design of insulting me,
you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, your reason,
and even against your character!<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a> Was not this some excuse for
incivility, if I was uncivil?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I very clearly explained that the objections which appealed to my reason
applied entirely to your <i>family</i>, and in no respect to yourself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I am a part of my family, Mr. Darcy; and allow me to say that, since I
have had the opportunity of comparing my relations with your own, the
contrast is not so marked as I had been led to suppose. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span>
<i>starts</i>.] But&mdash;aside from all questions of either feeling or family&mdash;do
you think any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps forever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister, and involving her in misery of the acutest kind? [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span>
<i>looks at her with a smile of incredulity.</i>.] Can you deny that you have
done this?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate
my friend from your sister. I did not, indeed, anticipate that I should
involve either of them in "misery" of any kind. On your sister's side,
at least, I was never able to discover any symptoms of peculiar regard
for Mr. Bingley. While, for every reason, I must rejoice in my success
with my friend; toward him I have been kinder than toward myself<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With disdain.</i>] Your arrogance in calmly deciding the extent of other
people's sentiments does not surprise me. It is of a piece with your
whole nature! But your interference in my sister's concerns is not all.
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your
character was unfolded in the recital which I received months ago from
Mr. Wickham. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>starts excitedly</i>.] What can you have to say on
this subject? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend
yourself?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a tone of suppressed excitement, in marked contrast to his previous
self-assured manner.</i>] You take an eager interest in that gentleman.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Contemptuously.</i>] His misfortunes! Yes, his misfortunes have been
great indeed!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With energy.</i>] And of your infliction! You have reduced him to his
present state of poverty&mdash;comparative poverty; you have withheld the
advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have
done all<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a> this, and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes
with contempt and ridicule!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Walking up and down the room with quick steps.</i>] And this is your
opinion of me? This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you
for explaining it so fully. [<i>Stopping and looking at her.</i>] Perhaps if
I were to divulge the truth regarding Mr. Wickham, I might give <i>you</i> as
great a surprise as you have given <i>me</i>. [<i>After a slight pause.</i>] I do
not care to go into particulars, but in justice to myself, I must tell
you that the man whom you consider a martyr is a profligate with the
most vicious propensities. A man who should never have entered your
home, for his presence there is a constant source of danger.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In indignation.</i>] Mr. Darcy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With dignity.</i>] I am ready to give you the full proofs of all I have
said, Miss Bennet, whenever you may so desire, although I would gladly
forget all the miserable circumstances myself, and no obligation less
than the present should induce me to unfold them to any human being.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coldly.</i>] Your judgment in the matter of my sister's happiness has
given me a gauge by which I can measure<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a> your fairness to a man who has
been so unfortunate as to offend you. My faith in Mr. Wickham is
unshaken.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>in indignation and by a great effort governing
himself</i>.] I shall take what you have said, Miss Bennet, as a reflection
on my <i>judgment</i> alone; otherwise, my veracity would be at stake, and
this, I am sure, you did not intend. Indeed I understand your whole
position perfectly. I have erred in the manner of my declaration. Your
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I concealed my
struggles. It is my own fault. I have wounded your pride. I should have
flattered you into the belief that I was impelled by inclination, by
reason, by reflection, by everything! But disguise of every sort is my
abhorrence. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Angrily.</i>] And do you expect <i>me</i> to rejoice in your proposal that I
ally myself to the conceit and impertinence of <i>yours</i>? No, Mr. Darcy!
The manner of your declaration has affected me only in one way:&mdash;it has
spared me the concern which I might otherwise have felt in refusing you,
had you behaved in a more <i>gentlemanlike</i> way. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>starts</i>.] You
could not, however, have made me the offer of your hand in any possible
way that would have tempted me to accept it. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>looks at her with
an expression of mortified amazement</i>.] I had not known<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a> you a month,
before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever
be prevailed upon to marry.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>You have said quite enough, Madam! I perfectly comprehend your feelings
and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for
having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your
health and happiness. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span> <i>hastily leaves the room</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sinking into a chair, then getting up and walking excitedly about the
room.</i>] To insult my family! To think I was ready to fall on my knees,
in gratitude for his condescension! To calmly dispose of Jane's
happiness! [<i>Stopping in her walk and with a half-amused smile.</i>] And
yet really to be in love with me in spite of every obstacle. [<i>Throwing
herself again into the chair, half laughing, half crying.</i>] Oh, Jane,
Jane! I wish you were here!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Martha.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Enters with a letter.</i>] Here is a letter, Miss. The express has just
brought it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>A letter? For me?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Maid.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Miss&mdash;[<i>She gives</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>the letter; curtsies and goes out</i>.<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at the letter.</i>] Why, it is from Jane! What can be the matter?
[<i>She opens the letter hurriedly and reads.</i>] "Dearest Lizzy&mdash;I have bad
news for you, and it cannot be delayed. An express came to us last night
from Colonel Forster. He told us that Lydia had run away from Brighton
with one of his officers:&mdash;to own the truth&mdash;with Wickham!"</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh! Wickham! [<i>Going on with the letter.</i>] "He first thought they had
gone to Scotland, but, oh, Lizzy, it is far worse than that! We now know
that Wickham never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all!"</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh! [<i>Reading again.</i>] "Colonel Forster has been here to-day. He says
Wickham is not a man to be trusted! He has left Brighton terribly in
debt, and his record is bad in every way. Oh, Lizzy, our distress is
very great! My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly
to try to discover the fugitives. It is hard to ask you to shorten your
visit, but we are in such distress that&mdash;&mdash;" [<i>Darting from her seat.</i>]
Oh where&mdash;where is the express? I must write. No&mdash;I must go. Oh, Lydia
and Wickham! I must go at once! I must send someone for a carriage.
[<i>She rushes to the garden door calling.</i>] Martha, Martha! The express!
[<i>Suddenly she calls again.</i>] Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam, is that you<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Appearing in the garden.</i>] What is the matter, Miss Bennet?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wildly.</i>] Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam&mdash;the express&mdash;or can you get me a
carriage? I have bad news from home. I must return at once and Mr.
Collins is away. Will you be so kind? [<i>She falls, half-fainting, upon a
chair near the door.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With concern.</i>] Certainly, my dear Miss Bennet&mdash;of course&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;
[<i>Calling off.</i>] Darcy, don't wait for me. I can't join you now. Miss
Bennet is in distress.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering.</i>] Miss Bennet? Good God! What is the matter?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Colonel Fitzwilliam.</span></p>

<p>Miss Bennet has just had bad news from home. She wishes to return, and
desires a carriage.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a decided tone.</i>] Do you go for the carriage, Fitzwilliam. Get one
from the stables. [<span class="smcap">Fitzwilliam</span> <i>hesitates</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Go. I will remain with Miss Bennet.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Fitzwilliam</span> <i>goes out</i>.<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>very gently</i>.] Shall I call the maid, Miss Bennet? A
glass of wine? Shall I get it for you? You are very ill.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hardly able to speak.</i>] No, I thank you: there is nothing the matter
with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news
which I have just received from Longbourn. [<i>She bursts into tears.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Helplessly.</i>] I am sorry, very indeed!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a short silence.</i>] I have just had a letter from Jane with such
<i>dreadful</i> news! It cannot be concealed from anyone.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>I am grieved, Miss Bennet. Grieved indeed!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Darcy, you were right. If I had only believed you! You, and
others! But I could not believe it. [<i>She sobs.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Greatly moved.</i>] What is it, my dear Miss Bennet? What has happened<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wildly.</i>] Oh, I cannot tell it, and yet everyone must know! My sister
Lydia&mdash;has&mdash;has eloped&mdash;has thrown herself into the power of&mdash;of <i>Mr.
Wickham</i>! She has no money, nothing that can tempt him to&mdash;she is lost
forever! [<i>She sobs again.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Good God, Miss Bennet! Your sister and Wickham! Oh, this is <i>my</i> fault.
I should have realised this danger&mdash;I should have spoken. My own
wretched experience with this man should have been told.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Wonderingly.</i>] Your experience!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;I&mdash;you remember. I hinted it to you&mdash;to-day. But I should long ago
have spoken boldly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wickham attempted this same plan with my own sister&mdash;two years ago.
She was an ignorant, innocent, trusting girl of fifteen. Happily, his
villainy was discovered and prevented. But oh, I should have told you!
Had his character been known, this could not have happened<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>You tried to tell me, Mr. Darcy. Everybody has tried to warn me. But I
could not believe it, and now&mdash;it is too late, too late!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Let us hope not. Is what you have told me certain&mdash;absolutely certain?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes. They left Brighton together on Sunday night. They are certainly
not gone to Scotland.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>And what has been done, or attempted, to recover your sister?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>My father has gone to London. He will beg my uncle Gardiner's
assistance. But nothing can be done! I know very well that nothing <i>can</i>
be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they ever to be
discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is all horrible!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Miss Bennet, I have made a wretched mistake in all this. Would to Heaven
that anything could be said or done on my part that might make you
reparation, or offer consolation to such distress!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Hill.</span></p>

for the rest of you, now that this disgrace has been brought upon
me&mdash;but if I had been able to carry my point&mdash;if I could have gone to
Brighton with all my family, this would never have happened. But poor
dear<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a> Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Oh, that villainous Wickham!
I am sure there was some great neglect or other somewhere, for Lydia is
not the kind of girl to run away with a man. But no one would listen to
me. I was overruled, as I always am. Poor Lydia! Poor dear child!</p>

<p>How can I help being excited? You have no feelings. Here is Mr. Bennet
gone away, and I know he will fight that abominable Wickham and be

out before Mr. Bennet is cold in his grave.</p>

<p>Yes, yes. My Uncle Gardiner is very kind. He is doing everything in his
power for us. He is helping my<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a> father now in London, you know. I hope
he will find Lydia, and perhaps he may be able to arrange a marriage

<p>No indeed, Madam. You must not indeed.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Brightening.</i>] Yes, Jane, that is true. My brother may be able to see
that they are married. Write to him at once, Jane. Tell him to find them
out wherever they may be, and if they are not married already, make them
marry. Oh, I do think that Wickham is the wickedest young man in the
world to so deceive my poor innocent Lydia. But, Jane, go and write my
brother and tell him that Lydia need not wait for wedding clothes&mdash;don't
let her even give directions till she has seen me, for she doesn't know
which are the best warehouses. And oh, Jane, tell my brother to keep
your father from fighting that hateful Wickham. Tell him what a dreadful
state I am in.</p>

<p>[<i>Lamenting.</i>] She had better stay here and be of some help. She has

Nobody knows what I suffer. I am frightened out of my wits. I have such

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Keeping the letter.</i>] No, I will tell you. Well, my father and my
uncle succeeded in finding Lydia. My aunt does not tell me just how it
was done.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Triumphantly.</i>] And your father found that they were married after
all. I told him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>No, mamma. They were not married, and they had no idea of being&mdash;but my
father and uncle insisted upon it. They took Lydia away at once to my
aunt's house and from there, they were married only yesterday at St.
Clement's Church.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>St. Clement's&mdash;fine!</p>

<p>My dear good uncle has arranged to have all Mr. Wickham's debts paid and
my father is to settle an allowance on Lydia.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>But where are they? What are they going to do?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>My father is coming home at once. He may be here at any moment. At first
he would not consent to let Lydia<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a> and Wickham come to us, but my aunt
and uncle urged it&mdash;and my father knew how anxious mamma would be&mdash;and
so <i>they</i> are coming here too.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>At once?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, directly, to-day.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear Lydia! How I long to see her, and to see my dear Wickham
too. But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I must write to my Sister
Gardiner about them directly.</p>

<p>[<i>She tries to get out of the chair.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, mamma, there is plenty of time for that.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Well, perhaps so. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall all be
together! I am so happy! Lydia married. She is Mrs. Wickham. How well it
sounds. My dear Jane, I must see about the clothes. We will settle with
your father about the money later. Oh, I am in such a flutter! Here
comes Hill. [<span class="smcap">Hill</span> <i>enters with the bottle</i>.] My dear Hill, have you
heard the news? Miss Lydia is married and is coming home directly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Hill.</span></p>

<p>Indeed<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry for her wedding,
and I am going into the house to write about the clothes. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>,
<i>who is going with her</i>.] No, Jane, you stay where you are. I know what
I am about. Come, Hill. Think of it&mdash;Mrs. Wickham!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She goes out leaning on</i> <span class="smcap">Hill's</span> <i>arm, leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> and <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
together.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Lizzy, how relieved and happy we should be. Is not it wonderful?
[<i>Anxiously.</i>] Are you sure it is true? Have you told us all?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Jane, it is true. They are really married. And for this we are to
be thankful. In spite of Lydia's folly and Wickham's wretched character,
we are to rejoice. How strange it is! Heigh-ho!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Putting out her hand for the letter which</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>still carries</i>.]
May not I read the letter, Lizzy?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>No, not now, dear. My aunt has some queer notions in her head. Later
perhaps. [<i>After a pause.</i>] I am very sorry now that in my agitation I
told Mr. Darcy about this wretched affair. Now that it has come out so<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>
well, he need never have known anything about it, and it would have
saved me a great deal of mortification.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>But how would you ever have explained things to Charlotte and Mr.
Collins without his help? Mr. Darcy made everything so smooth and
plausible for your sudden departure.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that is true.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Really, Lizzy, I think I shall have to take up the cudgels in Mr.
Darcy's defence. His kindness to you has quite won my heart, and his
amazing proposal was certainly a most flattering compliment. Why can you
see no good in Mr. Darcy, Lizzy? You were always so full of excuses for
Wickham, though it is true his open and delightful manners deceived us
all.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of
those two young men. One has all the goodness and the other all the
appearance of it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
did, and he certainly could hardly have had the friends he has if he did
not possess some good qualities.<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a> [<i>Shyly.</i>] Lizzy, have you heard that
Mr. Bingley is back in Netherfield?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astonished.</i>] Oh, Jane, no. When did he come? Have you seen him?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>No; I hardly expect to see him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Brightly.</i>] Yes, you will, if he has returned. [<i>Suddenly clapping her
hands.</i>] Oh, I understand. [<i>Kissing her.</i>] My darling Jane, you are
going to be very happy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Lizzy dear&mdash;don't, don't. That is all over now, and besides I don't want
to be happy unless you can be, too.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Oh, forty Mr. Bingleys wouldn't make me happy. Till I have your
disposition, I never can have happiness. No, no, let me shift for
myself. Perhaps if I have very good luck I may meet with another Mr.
Collins in time.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Harris.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering.</i>] Mr. Bennet has returned, Madam, and is looking for you.</p>

<p>Papa, tell us all about it quickly&mdash;quickly.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Are they really married, papa?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that misfortune is well settled on them. They are married fast
enough.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>And where are they? When will they be here?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I should say they would be here directly. I didn't care to travel with
them, but they are not far behind&mdash;only just far enough to keep out of
the dust of my post chaise.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Dear papa&mdash;how you must have suffered!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Say nothing of that&mdash;who should suffer but myself? It has been my own
doing, and I ought to feel it<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>You must not be too severe upon yourself.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>You may well warn me against such an evil. No, Lizzy, let me once in my
life feel how much I have been to blame. The impression will pass away
soon enough.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>But, papa, how did you persuade them to marry?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>I didn't persuade them; I haven't the means. It is all your uncle's
doing. He has managed to buy Wickham for us.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>Oh, dear good uncle!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>quizzically</i>.] But there are two things that I want
very much to know&mdash;one is how much money your uncle has laid down to
bring it about, and the other, how I am ever to pay him.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>But my uncle did not do it all?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>No, papa. My Aunt Gardiner has written me that you are to give Lydia an
allowance<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, one hundred a year. Do you think that any man in his proper senses
would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>That is very true, though it had not occurred to me before. Oh, it must
be my uncle's doings. Generous man! I am afraid he has distressed
himself. A small sum could not do all this.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>No, Wickham's a fool if he takes Lydia with a farthing less than ten
thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very
beginning of our relationship.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is one-half such a sum to be
repaid?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>That is what I should like to know.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Well, my uncle's kindness can never be requited. If such goodness as his
does not make Lydia miserable, then she will never deserve to be happy.</p>

<p>[<i>Laughter and voices are heard outside.</i><a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Surely I hear voices. [<i>Looking off.</i>] Why, they have come. See
papa&mdash;Jane&mdash;there are Lydia and Wickham.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mr. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Yes, here they are. I will go to the library. I can receive their
congratulations later. You know I am prodigiously fond of Wickham,
Lizzy. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable
son-in-law.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>I must run and tell mamma.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She is just starting when</i> <span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>enter. They are

unconcern and no shadow of shame.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Well, Jane, well, Lizzy, here we are!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling and unabashed.</i>] My sister, Jane&mdash;My sister Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He kisses their hands.</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>are confused and

discomposed</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking about.</i>] Good gracious! Here I am again! I am sure I had no
idea of being married when I went away, though I thought it would be
very good fun if I was. Why don't you take the boxes in, Harris?
Wickham, have you seen my pink-flowered bandbox? [<i>Looking over the
parcels.</i>] No, it isn't here. Oh, my dear Wickham, do go fetch it&mdash;you
know 'tis the box with the white satin hat you bought me. I wouldn't
lose it for the world. Go, go!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Wickham.</span></p>

<p>Certainly, my dear. [<i>To the girls.</i>] You see how eagerly I embrace my
new opportunities!</p>

<p>[<i>He runs out, laughing.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] Oh, girls, I am dying to give you an
account of my wedding.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I think there cannot be too little said on that subject.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>La, you are so strange. But Jane wants to hear, I know. Anyway, I want
to tell you. Well, there was such a fuss! My aunt was preaching and
talking away to me all the time I was dressing, just as if she was
reading a sermon. I didn't hear one word in ten of it all. I was<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>
thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be
married in his blue coat. Well, we got to church, and then my uncle gave
me a fright after we got there, because he was so late, and he was going
to give me away, you know. But then, if he hadn't come, Mr. Darcy might
have done as well.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane and Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Darcy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, Darcy was there. He came along with Wickham. [<i>Suddenly
stopping.</i>] But gracious me! I quite forgot. I ought not to have said a
word about it. I promised them as faithfully&mdash;what will Wickham say? It
was to be such a secret.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>If it was to be a secret, Lydia, say not another word on the subject. We
shall ask you no questions.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>looks most anxious, but says nothing</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Thank you&mdash;for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then
Wickham would be angry. [<i>She sees</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet</span>, <i>who enters in great
excitement from the house</i>.] Oh, there is mamma.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They rush into each other's arms.</i> <span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>returns at about the
same time</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, dear Lydia! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>with affectionate warmth</i>.] My
dear Wickham!</p>

<p>[<i>They also embrace.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, mamma! Aren't you glad to see us? [<span class="smcap">Wickham</span> <i>turns and talks to</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.] Do all the people hereabouts know that I am married? I
was afraid they might not, and so I let my hand just rest on the
window-frame outside the carriage, so that everybody could see my
wedding ring; and then I bowed and smiled like everything.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>You may be sure, my dear, that everybody will rejoice with us in our
good luck. [<i>Sighing.</i>] Your marriage is a great compensation to me
after all my disappointment about Jane and Lizzy. I do not blame Jane,
for she would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, Lydia,
it is very hard to think she might now have been Mrs. Collins! But how
about your clothes?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I have a lot already. You may be sure I would not forget <i>them</i>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bennet.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Alarmed.</i>] But you didn't know the best warehouses! Well, never mind,
we will see to that later. Now you must<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a> all come in and have dinner.
You must be famished. Come, girls. Come, my dear Wickham.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They all go toward the house. At the door</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>pushes</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>
<i>back</i>.]</p></div>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lydia.</span></p>

<p>Ah, Jane, I take your place now. I go first because I am a married
woman.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>They all go into the house. After a pause</i>, <span class="smcap">Harris's</span> <i>voice is

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Harris.</span></p>

<p>Will not you come into the house, Madam?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Harris</span>.] No, I prefer to remain here. Tell Miss
Elizabeth Bennet that a lady wishes to see her at once. Remember, I
cannot be kept waiting.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Harris.</span></p>

<p>Yes, Madam. [<i>He bows and goes out.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looks about her with a sniff, then deliberately seats herself in the
big garden chair with the umbrella over it. She mutters to herself from
time to time and taps her foot impatiently.</i>] Insufferable impudence!
Conceited little minx! She shall have a piece of my mind.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>comes to her from the house</i>.<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Without moving.</i>] Miss Bennet, you can be at no loss to understand the
reason of my journey hither. Your own heart&mdash;your own conscience must
tell you why I come.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In unaffected astonishment.</i>] Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I am
not at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Miss Bennet, you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with. I have
just been told that you&mdash;that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would in all
likelihood be soon married to my nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it to
be a scandalous falsehood, I instantly resolved on setting off for this
place that I might make my sentiments known to you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With astonishment and disdain.</i>] If you believed it impossible to be
true, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your
Ladyship propose by it?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] Your coming to Longbourn to see me and my<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a> family, will be
rather a confirmation of it, if indeed such a report is in existence.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Do you not know that such
a report is spread about?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I never heard that it was.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>And can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Your Ladyship may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist upon being satisfied. Has
he&mdash;has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It ought to be so. But your arts and allurements may have made him
forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn
him in<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am Mr. Darcy's own aunt, and am entitled to know all
his dearest concerns.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>But you are not entitled to know <i>mine</i>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Let me be rightly understood. This match can never take place. No,
never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you got to
say?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Only this&mdash;that if it is so, you can have no reason to suppose Mr. Darcy
will make an offer to me.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitating.</i>] The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. While
in their cradles, my sister and I planned their union. Do you pay no
regard to the wishes of his friends? Do not you see that honour,
decorum&mdash;nay, interest, forbid you marrying my nephew? Yes <i>interest</i>,
Miss Bennet. For you will be slighted and despised by everyone connected
with him<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>These are heavy misfortunes. But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such
extraordinary sources of happiness that she could have no cause to
repine.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a rage.</i>] Obstinate, headstrong girl! Tell me once for all&mdash;are you
engaged to my nephew?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitates, then firmly.</i>] I am not.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Relieved.</i>] And will you promise me never to enter into such an
engagement?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I will make no promise of the kind.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I shall not go away until you
have given me the assurance I require.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>And I certainly never shall give it. I must beg, therefore, to be
importuned no further on the subject.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a fury, but trying to speak calmly.</i>] Not so hasty, if you please.
I had hoped to spare you this last humiliation<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>&mdash;but your insolence
forbids it. I am no stranger to the particulars of your sister's
infamous elopement. I know all! The young man's marrying her was a
patched-up business at the expense of <i>my nephew</i>. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>starts
violently</i>.] Oh, you needn't start, Miss! Nobody knows about the whole
affair better than you. But I don't wonder you blush to find yourself
discovered. You used your arts well. My nephew must have spent full five
or six thousand pounds to save your family from disgrace. I should think
that such generosity might appeal a little to your gratitude and your
sense of decency.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Amazed.</i>] Oh, Madam,&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It is quite useless to protest. I have my facts from the best authority.
Heaven knows Darcy has reason enough to keep away from Wickham's
flirtations and entanglements, but [<i>stopping herself.</i>] that is a
family affair. However, <i>you</i> have managed to get him mixed up in them
again to the extent of five thousand pounds. But that is not
enough,&mdash;you want to make this shameless girl my nephew's <i>sister</i>, and
the son of his father's steward his brother. Heaven and Earth! Are the
shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Speaking with great effort.</i>] Madam, you have insulted<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a> me in every
possible manner. I must beg to return to the house. This is beyond
endurance.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Selfish girl! You are then resolved to have him?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Lady Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising from her chair.</i>] Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do
not imagine your ambition will be gratified. Depend upon it, I shall
carry my point. [<i>Going.</i>] I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. You
deserve no such attention. You will see what it is to rouse my
displeasure.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Lady Catherine</span> <i>goes out</i>.]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sinking upon the garden seat, overwhelmed.</i>] Can it be possible? Do we
owe all this to Darcy? Oh, it is intolerable! [<i>She puts her hands over
her face in an abandonment of grief.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Is heard outside calling.</i>] Lizzy! Lizzy! [<i>She enters, and on seeing
her sister rushes to her.</i>] Lizzy dear! What is it? Is there any new
trouble?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Throwing her arms about her sister.</i>] Oh, Jane, Jane!<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a> Yes, there is
no end of trouble. Lady Catherine has been here.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astounded.</i>] Lady Catherine!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, and&mdash;she says&mdash;that&mdash;oh, Jane&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Distressed.</i>] <i>Tell</i> me, Lizzy!</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>She says it was Darcy who paid all the money to Wickham&mdash;it was Darcy
saved us&mdash;and&mdash;and she says I persuaded him. <i>I</i> ensnared him, and&mdash;and
she has insulted me.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>My dear, dear Lizzy. There <i>must</i> be some mistake. It was my good uncle
who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>A little calmer.</i>] No&mdash;no, Jane, it must be true. I can put things
together now. My aunt's hints in the letter&mdash;you know I did not want to
show it you. Then what Lydia let fall, and her fear of Wickham's anger.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Soothingly.</i>] Well, dear, even so, Mr. Darcy's <i>motive</i> is clear
enough&mdash;and that should give you no pain<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>You are mistaken. I know his motive. He feels that he is responsible
because he was silent about Wickham's true character. He told me that
all this would never have happened, had he done his duty. And now, he
will despise us. He will never wish to see us again as long as he lives!</p>

<p>[<i>She walks up and down in great excitement.</i>]</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Harris.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Entering; to</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] The young gentlemen from Netherfield, Madam. I

<p>Oh, Jane, I <i>cannot</i> see them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>She tries to run away, but before she can escape</i> <span class="smcap">Bingley</span>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Embarrassed.</i>] Miss Bennet, believe me, I should not have followed my

my aunt coming away from here, and from something she said, I feared,&mdash;I

<p>[<i>Recovering herself.</i>] No&mdash;stay, Mr. Darcy. Excuse my own incivility.
Your aunt's visit has excited me. I shall be myself in a moment. [<span class="smcap">Darcy</span>
<i>stands by, miserable. At length she speaks in a calmer tone.</i>] Mr.
Darcy, your aunt has told me of our overwhelming obligation to you. You
must let me thank you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Exploding and banging his whip against his knees.</i>]</p>

<p>Damn!&mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Bennet. I <i>beg</i> your pardon. What
right has my aunt to meddle in my affairs? How <i>dare</i> she give you such
distress<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>?</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>It is far better that we know the truth, Mr. Darcy. For my part, I can
never express to you our obligation.</p>

<p>Oh, Miss Bennet&mdash;I beg of you! The obligation was entirely my own. I
only did what was my decent, plain duty. [<i>Faltering.</i>] You remember&mdash;I
told you&mdash;if I had spoken, this would never have happened.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I remember. But you exaggerated your responsibility. I&mdash;we&mdash;of
course my father will see you about your loan to us. I would not have
Lady Catherine think&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Furious again.</i>] Oh, I will settle matters with Lady Catherine! Have
no fears on that score, Miss Bennet. <i>She</i> shall be set right, I assure
you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>Thank you. And for all your trouble&mdash;your kindness&mdash;my family can never
repay you.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Your family owes me nothing. If I had any thought beyond my duty, it was
a thought of&mdash;you. [<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>turns away</i>.] Oh, pardon me. Perhaps, I
ought not to say all this&mdash;but I owe you a great deal, Miss
Bennet&mdash;<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>more than you can know; and I want you to understand me better.
I really am not the pretentious prig I must have seemed to you. I wish
you could forgive my abominable pride.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him with a half smile.</i>] I will, on one condition.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Name it.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>That you forget my unwarrantable prejudice.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Darcy.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Miss Bennet! [<i>He goes impetuously forward&mdash;then restraining
himself, smiles and looks down at her.</i>] I really think, after all, I
shall have to be grateful to my aunt. She has done us an enormous
service.</p>

<p class="charct"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling still more.</i>] Well, Lady Catherine loves to be useful!</p>

produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Internet Archive.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
